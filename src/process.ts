/** Process-liveness probe shared by every place that decides whether a recorded pid still

 * orchestrator-alive status (state.ts). */

/** True when a process with this pid exists — a signal-0 send, which cannot affect the
 * target. Any error reads as "not alive": no such process (ESRCH), or permission denied
 * (EPERM, e.g. the pid was recycled by another user's process) — the harness only probes
 * pids of its own fleet, so a live foreign holder must not be mistaken for one of ours.
 *
 * Anything that is not a positive integer reads as not alive without probing: signal 0
 * treats pid 0 as the caller's own process GROUP and a negative pid as another group
 * (kill(-1, 0) checks every process the user may signal), so both would report "alive" for
 * an id no process owns. A torn or foreign state/lock file (a pid field of 0, a negative or
 * fractional value) must not latch a dead holder as live — that would keep the merge lock
 * unbreakable for its full stale window, and make `tumwater run` refuse to start because a
 * phantom orchestrator looks alive. */
