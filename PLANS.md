# Plans

Planned features, written by the plan loop and implemented by the feature loop.
Each plan: goal, approach, files touched, acceptance criteria. Move finished plans to Done;
tumwater then archives them in PLANS-DONE.md, so this file holds only open work.

## Planned

### Plain terms code run, part 7/20: Convert the dashboard and the rest of history (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 6/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/ui/gui/ + src/gui/ + src/history/history.ts + src/history/history-render.ts + test/gui*.test.ts + test/cli-gui.test.ts + test/history*.test.ts + test/cli-history*.test.ts + test/fixtures/history-fixtures.ts)

**Goal.** The dashboard's browser code, the GUI server's run endpoint and the history command and renderer use run names, including the drawer's run list and the run-detail DOM attribute.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names; name any leftover serialized name in the commit message.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/gui/gui-endpoints.ts: `handleTick` → `handleRun` and `serveTick` → `serveRun`. The `/api/run` route and its legacy `/api/tick` handling are Plain terms scripting's; keep both routes working.
- Browser code in src/ui/gui/ (inside String.raw templates, which tsc does not check; grep all of src/ui/gui/ before each rename so names stay unique across the concatenated modules): `drawerTicks` → `drawerRuns`, `drawerTicksAt` → `drawerRunsAt`, `fmtLastTick` → `fmtLastRun`, `chartTicksByRole` → `chartRunsByRole`, `tickWord` → `runWord`, `todayTick` → `todayRun`, the DOM attribute `data-tickdetail` → `data-rundetail` (with its `dataset.tickdetail` reads and the `[data-tickdetail]` selector in gui-client-boot.ts), and uses of `lastTickCell` and `TickResult` → the new names. test/helpers/gui-client-scope.ts reaches browser functions by name; update it.
- src/history/history.ts and history-render.ts: `TickRowCells` → `RunRowCells`, `tickRowCells` → `runRowCells` and `tickRowLine` → `runRowLine` (aliased if src/ui/tui still uses them), and migrate `RunRow`, `readRunRows`, `summarizeRunRows` and the other names part 6/20 introduced.
- Tests: test/gui*.test.ts, test/cli-gui.test.ts, test/history*.test.ts except history-data (part 6/20's), test/cli-history*.test.ts, and test/fixtures/history-fixtures.ts (`repoWithTicks` → `repoWithRuns`).

**Files touched.** src/ui/gui/*.ts, src/gui/*.ts, src/history/history.ts, src/history/history-render.ts, test/helpers/gui-client-scope.ts, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|tickdetail'` over this part's files lists only aliases and serialized names.
- The dashboard tests that open a run's detail from the drawer pass, and `GET /api/run` and the legacy `GET /api/tick` both still answer.
- No behavior change: the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 8/20: Rename the runner's run pipeline phases (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 7/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/runner/runner.ts + src/runner/runner-run.ts + test/runner.test.ts + test/runner-2.test.ts through test/runner-5.test.ts)

**Goal.** The runner's run pipeline (`runPhase`, `runOncePhase`, `runOnceInLeasePhase`, `runWithWorktreePhase`) and the runner's comments and core tests use run wording throughout.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names; name any leftover serialized name in the commit message.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/runner/runner-run.ts: `tickPhase` → `runPhase`, `runTickPhase` → `runOncePhase` (it pairs with `RoleRunner.runOnce`), `runTickInLeasePhase` → `runOnceInLeasePhase`, `tickWithWorktreePhase` → `runWithWorktreePhase`, and the locals `quietKilledTick`, `tickBase`, `nTick` and `tickOutcome` → run forms. This file has about 150 tick lines; most are comments describing the pipeline, and most of its "run" nouns mean the agent run, so apply the "agent run" rule here with care.
- src/runner/runner.ts: comments ("one full tick of this role" → "one full run of this role"), and uses of `RunOutcome`, `RunUsage`, `runPhase` and `runOncePhase`.
- Tests test/runner.test.ts and test/runner-2.test.ts through test/runner-5.test.ts: migrate names, comments and titles. docs/invariants.md quotes test/runner-2.test.ts titles ("a tick whose agent reads an image on a blind model stops and fails", "a blind read on a text-only …"); update the quotes to the renamed titles.

**Files touched.** src/runner/runner.ts, src/runner/runner-run.ts, test/runner.test.ts, test/runner-2.test.ts, test/runner-3.test.ts, test/runner-4.test.ts, test/runner-5.test.ts, docs/invariants.md (quotes only).

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `runPhase`, `runOncePhase`, `runOnceInLeasePhase` and `runWithWorktreePhase` are declared, and no tick-named function remains in src/runner/runner-run.ts.
- `grep -nE '[Tt]ick|TICK'` over this part's seven code files prints nothing except kept senses.
- No behavior change: the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 9/20: Convert the rest of the runner modules and tests (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 8/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/runner/ except runner.ts and runner-run.ts + src/roles/runner-ids.ts + the other test/runner-*.test.ts + test/revision.test.ts + test/leftover.test.ts + test/model-fallback.test.ts + test/fixtures/runner-*.ts)

**Goal.** Runner state, the agent wrapper, recovery, leftover handling and model fallback use run wording, and `finishAbortedRunPhase` and `finishRecoveryRunPhase` replace their tick names.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names; name any leftover serialized name in the commit message. `RunnerState`'s persisted fields were renamed by Plain terms state.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/runner/runner-recovery.ts: `finishAbortedTickPhase` → `finishAbortedRunPhase` and `finishRecoveryTickPhase` → `finishRecoveryRunPhase`.
- src/runner/runner-state.ts (about 73 tick lines, mostly comments), runner-pi.ts (the agent wrapper, where "run" is mostly the agent run: apply the "agent run" rule), leftover.ts, model-fallback.ts, runner-fallback.ts, revision.ts and src/roles/runner-ids.ts: comments and identifiers.
- Tests: test/runner-{counters,fallback,ids,interrupted,leftover-recovery,merge-conflicts,pi,pi-claude,pi-followups,pi-retry,prompt-requeue,quiet-watchdog,recovery,red-main,refusal,state,transient-retry}.test.ts, test/revision.test.ts, test/leftover.test.ts and test/model-fallback.test.ts. Fixture locals in test/fixtures/runner-fixtures.ts and runner-pi-fixtures.ts: `abortHungImproveTick` → `abortHungImproveRun`, `afterFallbackTick` → `afterFallbackRun`, `tickEvents` → `runEvents`, `tickEnds` → `runEnds`, `tick2End` → `run2End`.

**Files touched.** src/runner/runner-state.ts, runner-pi.ts, runner-recovery.ts, runner-fallback.ts, leftover.ts, model-fallback.ts, revision.ts, src/roles/runner-ids.ts, test/fixtures/runner-fixtures.ts, test/fixtures/runner-pi-fixtures.ts, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `finishAbortedRunPhase` and `finishRecoveryRunPhase` are declared; `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick|TICK' src/runner src/roles/runner-ids.ts` prints only kept senses.
- `grep -nE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b'` over this part's tests and fixtures lists only mock-clock calls and serialized names.
- No behavior change: the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 10/20: Rename the orchestrator's run launch and timing names (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 9/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/orchestrator/ + the non-e2e test/orchestrator-*.test.ts + test/fixtures/orchestrator-fixtures.ts)

**Goal.** The orchestrator launches and times runs by run names: `launchDueRuns`, `ROLE_RUN_DURATION_SAMPLES`, `roleRunDurationsMs` and `runsDone`.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names; name any leftover serialized name in the commit message. The `restart` event's `abortedRuns` field is Plain terms event log's.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/orchestrator/orchestrator-poll.ts (the poll steps split out of `runOrchestrator`) reads `tickStartHeld` and `roleTickDurationsMs`: rename those uses with the members below.
- src/orchestrator/orchestrator-launch.ts: `launchDueTicks` → `launchDueRuns`, `ROLE_TICK_DURATION_SAMPLES` → `ROLE_RUN_DURATION_SAMPLES`, member `roleTickDurationsMs` → `roleRunDurationsMs`, `tickStartHeld` → `runStartHeld` and `roleTickP75Ms` → `roleRunP75Ms` (a member read by src/redeploy/; rename those uses here). Locals `tickIdx`, `tickCalls` and `roleTicksInFlight` → run forms.
- src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts: the exit-info member `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, renamed with its uses in src/cli/cli-start.ts (`onceSummary`/`onceFailures` parameters) and src/scheduling/once-round.ts (the `ticksRun(runner)` method → `runsDone(runner)`); `recordFallbackTickAt` and `deferTick` uses as they stand. orchestrator-scheduling.ts and retention.ts: comments.
- test/fixtures/orchestrator-fixtures.ts: `awaitSettledTick` → `awaitSettledRun` (aliased: the e2e tests in part 11/20 use it about 38 times), `timedTickHarness` → `timedRunHarness`, `awaitFirstTick` → `awaitFirstRun`.
- Tests test/orchestrator-{launch,seams,scheduling,probe,defer,director,redeploy,once,fallback,divergence,start-event-best-effort}.test.ts. In test/orchestrator-probe.test.ts, `ticksAt` → `runsAt` and `ticksAtTrip` → `runsByRoleAtTrip`, because a `runsAtTrip` local already exists there. `tickedFeature` → `ranFeature`.

**Files touched.** src/orchestrator/*.ts, the `ticksRun`/`roleTickP75Ms` uses in src/cli/cli-start.ts, src/scheduling/once-round.ts and src/redeploy/, test/fixtures/orchestrator-fixtures.ts, and the non-e2e orchestrator tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `launchDueRuns`, `ROLE_RUN_DURATION_SAMPLES` and `awaitSettledRun` are declared, and `runsDone` replaces `ticksRun` everywhere in src/ and test/.
- `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b' src/orchestrator` prints only serialized names.
- No behavior change: the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 11/20: Convert the orchestrator end-to-end tests (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 10/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches test/orchestrator*.e2e.test.ts)

**Goal.** Mechanical, test-only. The orchestrator e2e suites use run names in their helpers, locals, comments and test titles.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep node:test mock-clock calls and serialized names (event types and fields in assertions, state fields), which were renamed earlier.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - Migrate every use of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias no other file names any more (test/exports.test.ts).
- Files: test/orchestrator.e2e.test.ts, orchestrator-2, orchestrator-3, orchestrator-budget, orchestrator-permits, orchestrator-pause, orchestrator-redeploy, orchestrator-once, orchestrator-resize, orchestrator-quiet-hours and orchestrator-mixed (all `.e2e.test.ts`).
- Helpers and locals: `awaitSettledTick` → `awaitSettledRun`, then delete its alias in test/fixtures/orchestrator-fixtures.ts if nothing else uses it. `removedTicks`, `tickQueued`, `cleanTicks` and `minTickInterval` → run forms. `dryTicks` → `dedupeRuns`, its final name, so Plain terms code cleanup does not touch it again. Migrate `runTimedRoleRun` uses; `deferTick` and `restoreMidTickWake` keep their names until part 12/20 renames them.

**Files touched.** The eleven `test/orchestrator*.e2e.test.ts` files; test/fixtures/orchestrator-fixtures.ts (alias removal only).

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `grep -nE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b' test/orchestrator*.e2e.test.ts` lists only serialized names and names a later part of this series owns (`deferTick`, `restoreMidTickWake`).
- No test added or removed: the e2e test count is unchanged and `npm run test:e2e` passes.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 12/20: Rename the scheduler's deferral and wake names and convert the gates (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 11/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/scheduling/ + src/gates/ + their tests + test/fixtures/gate-fixtures.ts)

**Goal.** The scheduler and the gates use run names: `deferRun`, `deferRunReason`, `restoreMidRunWake` and `runOnPair`.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names; name any leftover serialized name in the commit message.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/scheduling/: `deferTick` → `deferRun` and `deferTickReason` → `deferRunReason`, both aliased (orchestrator, roles and tests use them); `restoreMidTickWake` → `restoreMidRunWake`; the `exitReady` argument members `roleTicks` → `roleRuns` and `directorTicks` → `directorRuns` (rename the call in src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts too); the local `tickSnapshots` → `runSnapshots`. Comments in scheduling.ts, backoff.ts, once-round.ts, claims.ts, quiet-hours.ts and the work-merged cache module ("the min-tick-interval clock" → "the min-run-interval clock").
- src/gates/: `tickOnPair` → `runOnPair` (aliased if src/budget still uses it); comments in gate-polls.ts, budget-gates.ts, streak-gate.ts, pause-gates.ts, maintenance-quota.ts, startup-gate.ts, role-cap-gates.ts, disk-gate.ts and bootstrap-gates.ts.
- Tests: test/scheduling.test.ts (about 90 lines), test/once-round.test.ts, test/backoff.test.ts, test/claims.test.ts, test/quiet-hours.test.ts, test/gate-polls.test.ts, test/gate-event-best-effort.test.ts, test/streak-gate.test.ts, test/maintenance-quota.test.ts, test/disk-gate.test.ts, test/role-cap-gates.test.ts, test/pause-gates.test.ts, test/bootstrap-gates.test.ts, test/startup-gate.test.ts and test/fixtures/gate-fixtures.ts.

**Files touched.** src/scheduling/*.ts, src/gates/*.ts, the `exitReady` call in src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `deferRun`, `deferRunReason`, `restoreMidRunWake` and `runOnPair` are declared; old names survive only as aliases still used elsewhere.
- `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b' src/scheduling src/gates` prints only aliases and serialized names.
- No behavior change: the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 13/20: Convert the budget and failure modules (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 12/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/budget/ + src/failure/ + their tests)

**Goal.** The budget breaker and the failure digest use run names: `recordFallbackRun`, `RUN_TIMEOUT_KEY` and `prevRuns`.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names; name any leftover serialized name in the commit message.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/budget/fallback-breaker.ts and budget.ts: `recordFallbackTick` → `recordFallbackRun` and `recordFallbackTickAt` → `recordFallbackRunAt` (aliased if the orchestrator still names them, otherwise migrate its two uses). Comments.
- src/failure/ (failure-data.ts, time-spend.ts, failure-render.ts, failure-cluster.ts, failure-state-change.ts): `TICK_TIMEOUT_KEY` → `RUN_TIMEOUT_KEY`, `TICK_TIMEOUT_PROGRESSING_KEY`, `TICK_TIMEOUT_PROGRESSING_REVIEW_KEY` and `TICK_TIMEOUT_PROGRESSING_REVIEW_RESUME_KEY` → `RUN_TIMEOUT_…` (migrate their uses in src/team/). These are names of in-process cluster keys; if a key's string value is persisted or printed, leave the value, which Plain terms text or event log owns. The `RoleStats` member `prevTicks` → `prevRuns`; locals `tickEvents` → `runEvents` and `tickEnd` → `runEnd`. The failure digest's comments speak of "the telemetry role"; that role id is Plain terms code cleanup's.
- Tests: test/budget*.test.ts, test/fallback-breaker.test.ts, test/failure*.test.ts and test/time-spend.test.ts.

**Files touched.** src/budget/*.ts, src/failure/*.ts, the `TICK_TIMEOUT_*` uses in src/team/, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `recordFallbackRun`, `recordFallbackRunAt` and `RUN_TIMEOUT_KEY` are declared; old names survive only as aliases still used elsewhere.
- `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b' src/budget src/failure` prints only aliases and serialized names.
- No behavior change: failure digest and budget output in the tests is unchanged, and the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 14/20: Convert the event and report and file and text helpers (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 13/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/events/ + src/report/ + src/files/ + src/text/ + their tests + test/fakes/log.ts + test/fixtures/log-fixtures.ts)

**Goal.** The event readers, report fold, file helpers and text helpers use run names: `eventRun`, `runSpanMs`, `runStartMap`, `runStart` and `runEnd`.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names; name any leftover serialized name in the commit message. `normalizeLegacyEvent`'s map from `tick_*` types to `run_*` types is a legacy reader: its old names stay.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/events/ and src/files/: `eventTick` → `eventRun`, `tickSpanMs` → `runSpanMs`, `tickStartMap` → `runStartMap`, the helpers `tickStart`/`tickEnd` → `runStart`/`runEnd`, and `tickDurationMs` → `runDurationMs`, each aliased where src/history/, src/roles/ or src/ui/ still use it. Check each new name with `grep -rnw` first, because `runStart` must not collide with a local in the same module. Comments in events.ts, event-format.ts, event-read.ts, event-window.ts and notify.ts.
- src/report/ (report-data.ts, report-render.ts): locals such as `totalTicks` → `totalRuns`, and comments. The report JSON keys are Plain terms scripting's.
- src/text/ (phrases.ts, datetime.ts, text.ts, format.ts): comments.
- Tests: test/event*.test.ts, test/events.test.ts, test/notify*.test.ts, test/report*.test.ts, test/cli-logs*.test.ts, test/log-commands*.test.ts, test/datetime.test.ts, test/fakes/log.ts (`seedTickEvents` → `seedRunEvents`) and test/fixtures/log-fixtures.ts.

**Files touched.** src/events/*.ts, src/report/*.ts, src/files/*.ts, src/text/*.ts, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `eventRun`, `runSpanMs`, `runStartMap`, `runStart` and `runEnd` are declared; old names survive only as aliases still used elsewhere.
- `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b' src/events src/report src/files src/text` lists only the legacy event-type map, aliases and serialized names.
- No behavior change: `logs` and `report` output in the tests is unchanged, and the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 15/20: Convert the status display and the TUI (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 14/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/ui/*.ts + src/ui/tui/ + their tests)

**Goal.** The status model and renderer, the run-progress model and the TUI use run names: `lastRunCell`, `runProgress`, `progressOfRun` and `runStat`.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names; name any leftover serialized name in the commit message.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead.

Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/ui/status-render.ts: `lastTickCell` → `lastRunCell` (aliased if src/text/ or src/budget/ still use it). src/ui/run-progress-model.ts: `tickProgress` → `runProgress` and comments ("a tick with no recorded start time" → "a run with …"); its `ProgressRunKind` already says run. src/ui/progress-data.ts: `progressOfTick` → `progressOfRun`, and its many "run" nouns that mean the agent run get the "agent run" rule. Comments in status-model.ts (about 50 lines), status-payload.ts, team-alerts.ts, tone.ts, badges.ts and transcript.ts.
- src/ui/tui/ (tui-keys.ts has about 54 lines, plus tui-history.ts, tui-pane.ts, tui.tsx, tui-editors.ts and tui-frame.ts): the local `tickStat` → `runStat`; migrate `renderRunDetail`, `readRunRows`, `readRunDetail`, `RunRow`, `RunDetail`, `runRowCells`, `HISTORY_DEFAULT_RUNS`, `runRowsMatchingGrep`, `runDetailStat` and `runRowGrepHaystack`; then delete each of those aliases that no other file still names. Comments.
- Tests: test/status-model.test.ts, test/status-render*.test.ts, test/status-payload.test.ts, test/team-alerts.test.ts, test/progress.test.ts, test/tui*.test.ts and test/fixtures/tui-fixtures.ts.

**Files touched.** src/ui/*.ts, src/ui/tui/*.ts(x), alias deletions in src/run/ and src/history/, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `lastRunCell`, `runProgress` and `progressOfRun` are declared, and `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b' src/ui --include=*.ts --include=*.tsx` (excluding src/ui/gui/) prints only serialized names.
- The run-detail and history aliases this part's files were the last users of are gone (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`).
- No behavior change: TUI frames and status output in the tests are unchanged, and the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 16/20: Convert the prompt builders and the inbox and operator modules (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 15/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/prompt/ + src/inbox/ + src/operator/ + their tests)

**Goal.** The prompt builders take run names, `buildRunPrompt` and `RUN_PROMPT`, and the inbox and operator modules lose their tick wording.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names; name any leftover serialized name in the commit message. Prompt text and `Run:`/`Tick:` trailer patterns inside string literals were handled by Plain terms text and state; do not touch strings.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/prompt/prompt.ts: `buildTickPrompt` → `buildRunPrompt`, aliased because test/prompt-roles.test.ts (part 17/20) calls it about 21 times. `TICK_PROMPT` → `RUN_PROMPT`; check whether it is only a test-local name. src/prompt/prompt-followup.ts: the parameter `tickPrompt` → `runPrompt`. Comments in prompt.ts, gate-prompts.ts and principles.ts.
- src/inbox/ (pending-prompt.ts, inbox.ts, inbox-submit.ts, inbox-edit.ts, inbox-attachments.ts, prompt-commands.ts, prompt-not-before.ts, inbox-cancel.ts) and src/operator/ (operator-commands.ts, operator-requests.ts, operator-intent.ts, retire.ts): comments, plus uses of `abortRun` and `finishAbortedRun`.
- Tests: test/prompt.test.ts (about 77 lines), test/prompt-steward.test.ts, test/prompt-resume.test.ts, test/prompt-dialect.test.ts, test/prompt-followup.test.ts, test/prompt-commands.test.ts, test/pending-prompt.test.ts, test/gate-prompts.test.ts, test/inbox*.test.ts (keep test/inbox.test.ts's `clock.tick`), test/operator*.test.ts and test/retire.test.ts.

**Files touched.** src/prompt/*.ts, src/inbox/*.ts, src/operator/*.ts, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `buildRunPrompt` is declared and `buildTickPrompt` survives only as an alias.
- `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b' src/prompt src/inbox src/operator` prints only serialized names and string literals.
- No behavior change: the assembled prompts in the tests are byte-identical, and the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 17/20: Convert config and roles and init (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 16/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/config/ + src/roles/ + src/init/ + their tests)

**Goal.** The config, role and init modules and their tests use run wording and the new prompt-builder name.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names. The legacy config keys `minTickIntervalSeconds` and `tickTimeoutSeconds` stay in the alias tables, and test/config-validation.test.ts's near-miss `tickTimeoutSecondss`-style fixtures belong to Plain terms commands. Name any leftover serialized name in the commit message.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.

Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/roles/: `LONGEST_LEGITIMATE_TICK_S` → `LONGEST_LEGITIMATE_RUN_S` and the local `tickInterval` → `runInterval`; migrate `deferRun`, `eventRun`, `runStartMap` and `assembleRunPrompt` uses; convert comments in role-view.ts, roles.ts, role-render.ts, role-catalog.ts and role-guidance.ts. Comments only; strings are not this series'.
- src/config/ (config-schema.ts has about 29 comment lines, plus config.ts, config-views.ts, config-validation.ts, config-fallbacks.ts, config-write.ts, config-live.ts and config-field-checks.ts) and src/init/ (init.ts, init-templates.ts): comments and uses.
- Tests: test/prompt-roles.test.ts (migrate `buildRunPrompt`, then delete the `buildTickPrompt` alias if nothing else names it), test/role*.test.ts, test/config*.test.ts and test/init*.test.ts.

**Files touched.** src/config/*.ts, src/roles/*.ts, src/init/*.ts, the `buildTickPrompt` alias in src/prompt/prompt.ts, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `LONGEST_LEGITIMATE_RUN_S` is declared, and `buildTickPrompt` appears nowhere unless another file still names it.
- `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b' src/config src/roles src/init` prints only the legacy config-key aliases and serialized names.
- No behavior change: the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 18/20: Convert the merge and review and verdict and baseline modules (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 17/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/merge/ + src/review/ + src/verdict/ + src/baseline/ + their tests)

**Goal.** The merge pipeline, the reviewer, the verdict parsers and the main-baseline modules use run wording and `RunResult`/`RunOutcome`.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names. Merge-queue entry fields and the `Run:`/`Tick:` trailer parsers are Plain terms state's: both trailer spellings must still parse. Name any leftover serialized name in the commit message.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run": the reviewer's runs are "review runs"; a bare "the run" there that means the reviewer's agent invocation → "the agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/merge/ (merge-core.ts, merge-to-main.ts, merge-queue.ts, merge-check-failures.ts, merge-batch.ts, merge-slot.ts, merge-pipeline.ts, merge-drain.ts, merge-git.ts, merge-verify.ts, merge-queue-render.ts; names as Plain terms code merge left them): migrate `TickResult` → `RunResult` (about 29 lines) and `runTimedRoleRun`, `runOnce` and `finalizeRun` uses, and convert comments.
- src/review/ (review.ts, review-precheck.ts, review-verdict.ts), src/verdict/ (refusal.ts, no-change.ts, reply-contract.ts, fix-claim.ts) and src/baseline/ (main-red.ts, main-baseline.ts; its "run" nouns are mostly check runs, which stay): uses and comments.
- Tests: the merge tests and fixtures (test/merge*.test.ts, test/merger*.test.ts, test/fixtures/merge*-fixtures.ts and test/fixtures/merger-fixtures.ts), test/review*.test.ts, test/reply-contract.test.ts, test/refusal.test.ts, test/main-*.test.ts, test/fix-claim.test.ts and test/exemptions.test.ts.

**Files touched.** src/merge/*.ts, src/review/*.ts, src/verdict/*.ts, src/baseline/*.ts, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b' src/merge src/review src/verdict src/baseline` prints only the legacy `Tick:` trailer pattern and serialized names.
- Both `Run:` and `Tick:` trailers still parse (their existing tests pass unchanged apart from titles).
- No behavior change: the suite's test count is unchanged.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 19/20: Rename the start command code and convert CLI and team and doctor and status modules (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 18/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names" and "Commands and config"; touches src/cli/ + src/cli.ts + src/process/supervisor.ts + src/build/build-stage.ts + src/team/ + src/doctor/ + src/status/ + src/backlog/ + src/brief/ + src/change/ + src/redeploy/ + root modules + their tests)

**Goal.** The `tumwater start` command's code is named for it (`cmdStart`, `START_FLAG_SPECS`, `superviseStart`, `spawnStartChild`). The CLI, team, doctor, status, backlog, brief, change and redeploy modules lose their tick wording.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, and serialized names; name any leftover serialized name in the commit message.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run"; in src/cli/cli-start.ts, "this run" meaning the whole `tumwater start` process → "this session". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
  - An export used outside this part keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, unless it has about five or fewer outside use lines, which you migrate instead. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members get no alias. Migrate this part's uses of earlier renames (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), and delete any alias nothing else names (test/exports.test.ts).
- Start-command names: in src/cli/cli-start.ts, `cmdRun` → `cmdStart` and `superviseRunCommand` → `superviseStartCommand`; in src/cli/cli-flag-specs.ts, `RUN_FLAG_SPECS` → `START_FLAG_SPECS`; in src/process/supervisor.ts, `superviseRun` → `superviseStart` and `spawnRunChild` → `spawnStartChild`, with their uses in src/cli.ts, src/cli/cli-start.ts and src/build/build-stage.ts and their tests. Plain terms commands may already have renamed some of these; rename whichever remain.
- Do not change any argv. The supervisor spawns its child as `["run", …extraArgs]` (in `spawnStartChild`), and that literal `run` must stay. `run` stays a hidden alias of `tumwater start`, so a rollback to an older build, whose CLI only knows `run`, can still respawn the child. Add a one-line comment at the spawn site saying so. Likewise keep src/cli.ts's `case "run":` dispatch (the hidden alias), and keep every `cli(…, "run", …)` and `spawnCli(…, ["run"])` call in tests that deliberately exercises the alias.
- Other src/cli/ renames: `ticksBefore` → `runsBefore` and `ticksThisRound` → `runsThisRound` (parameters and locals in cli-start.ts), and the local `tickRow` → `runRow`. Migrate `cmdRunDetail`, `RUN_DETAIL_USAGE`, `summarizeRunRows` and `readRunRowsSince` uses, and delete those aliases if this was their last user. Convert comments in cli-start.ts (about 37 lines), cli-flag-specs.ts, cli-command-args.ts, help.ts, config-commands.ts and cli-query-commands.ts; help text strings are not this series'.
- Root modules: src/request-timeouts.ts `tickCapS` → `runCapS`; comments in src/cli.ts, src/paths.ts and src/collections.ts.
- src/team/, src/doctor/, src/status/, src/backlog/, src/brief/, src/change/ and src/redeploy/ (redeploy-policy.ts and redeployer.ts have about 32 lines): comments and uses (`roleRunP75Ms`, `RUN_TIMEOUT_KEY`, `lastRunCell`).
- Tests: test/cli-start*.test.ts, test/cli.test.ts, test/cli-operators*.test.ts, test/cli-queue.test.ts, test/cli-command-args.test.ts, test/cli-arg-strictness.test.ts (its `cli(repo, "tick", …)` call exercises the hidden alias; keep it), test/cli-preflight.test.ts, test/cli-output.test.ts, test/cli-harness.test.ts, test/completion.test.ts, test/team*.test.ts, test/doctor*.test.ts, test/status-data*.test.ts, test/redeploy*.test.ts, test/error-storm.test.ts, test/backlog-*.test.ts, test/brief.test.ts, test/change-data.test.ts, test/paths.test.ts, test/request-timeouts.test.ts, test/build-stage.test.ts, test/supervisor.test.ts, test/helpers/start-live-harness.ts, test/helpers/wait.ts, test/helpers/oracles.ts and test/fixtures/status-fixtures.ts.

**Files touched.** src/cli/*.ts, src/cli.ts, src/process/supervisor.ts, src/build/build-stage.ts, src/request-timeouts.ts, src/paths.ts, src/collections.ts, src/team/*.ts, src/doctor/*.ts, src/status/*.ts, src/backlog/*.ts, src/brief/*.ts, src/change/*.ts, src/redeploy/*.ts, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `cmdStart`, `START_FLAG_SPECS`, `superviseStart`, `superviseStartCommand` and `spawnStartChild` are declared; `cmdRun`, `RUN_FLAG_SPECS`, `superviseRun` and `spawnRunChild` appear nowhere in src/ or test/.
- The supervisor's spawn argv is still `["run", …]` and src/cli.ts still dispatches `run`: test/supervisor.test.ts and the test/cli-start*.test.ts suites pass with their argv assertions unchanged.
- `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_|\bticks?\b'` over this part's src directories prints only hidden-alias strings and serialized names.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code run, part 20/20: Convert the agent backends and sweep and retire the old run names (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 19/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names" and "Guards"; touches src/pi/ + src/agent/ + src/pi-extension/ + every remaining file with a tick name + test/retired-names.test.ts)

**Goal.** No identifier, file name, comment or test title in src/ or test/ says "tick" for a run, the agent backends say "agent run" where a bare "run" was ambiguous, every deprecated alias from this series is gone, and test/retired-names.test.ts fails if an old run name comes back.

**Approach.**
- Series rules (every code-run part):
  - Identifier words follow plans/terminology.md "Code names", row "tick": `tick`/`Tick`/`TICK` → `run`/`Run`/`RUN`, `ticks` → `runs`, `ticked` → `ran`. Settled collisions: `runTick` → `runOnce`, `runTimedRoleTick` → `runTimedRoleRun`, `tickModel` → `runModelPair`, `ticksRun` → `runsDone`, `cmdTick` → `cmdRunDetail`.
  - A bare `tick` binding or in-process field holding a run number → `runNumber`; `ticks` holding a count → `runs`, or `runCount` if `runs` is bound in scope. Never shadow an existing binding such as `run`.
  - Keep `backtick*`, `process.nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, `sticky`, node:test mock-clock `tick(ms)` calls and their helpers, hidden-alias argv strings (`"tick"`, `"run"`), legacy readers' old names, and serialized names.
  - Legacy readers keep the old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them: the legacy-name tables in `normalizeLegacyEvent`, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` path helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and test fixtures that deliberately write old event names or state keys to disk. test/retired-names.test.ts exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions; mark any new such site with one of those, never a new mechanism.
  - Comments and test titles: "tick" → "run" (and "ticks", "ticked", "mid-tick", "per-tick" alike), `tumwater tick <role> <n>` → `tumwater history <role> <n>`, `tumwater run` → `tumwater start`. A bare noun "run" meaning one agent invocation → "agent run". Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles, `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects alone; rewrap comments past 100 columns; update docs/invariants.md quotes of test titles you change.
- src/pi/ (pi-watchdogs.ts, pi-run-result.ts, pi-stream.ts, pi-args.ts, pi-event-line.ts, pi-bin.ts, pi-backend.ts, command-shape.ts), src/agent/ (run-agent.ts, session-ledger.ts, claude/claude-args.ts, claude/claude-account.ts) and src/pi-extension/ (full-output.ts, context-shake.ts, context-budget.ts, bounded-output.ts): the `PiWatchdogs`/run-agent member `tickTimeoutMs` → `runTimeoutMs`; "the tick deadline" → "the run deadline"; and the "agent run" rule, which matters most here because "run" in these modules almost always means one pi or claude process. "pi run" stays.
- Sweep everything left: run `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_' src test` and `grep -rnwiE 'ticks?|ticked|ticking' src test`, and convert every run sense, including files a feature added during this series. Known stragglers: test/pi*.test.ts, test/fixtures/repo-fixtures.ts, test/test-runner.ts, test/agent-commit-fold.test.ts (`tickAndMerge` → `runAndMerge`), test/fakes-catalog.test.ts, test/fakes/fake-pi.ts, test/helpers/wait.ts and test/fixtures/pi-events.ts.
- Delete every remaining `@deprecated` alias this series added (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test`), after migrating their last users.
- Append a `run` family to the guard in test/retired-names.test.ts, in the `{ family, words, fileWords, allow }` shape. Use `words: ["tick", "ticks", "ticked", "ticking"]`, `fileWords: ["tick", "ticks"]` and `allow: ["nextTick", "processTicksAndRejections"]` (Node's names, with that reason comment). The `tumwater run` command's old code names cannot be words, because "run" is the new word. List them exactly in an optional `identifiers` field: `cmdRun`, `RUN_FLAG_SPECS`, `superviseRun`, `superviseRunCommand`, `spawnRunChild`. Plain terms code team's design anticipates that field; if the guard has no `identifiers` yet, add it, with a guard test that an exact name fails. The node:test mock-clock calls (`t.mock.timers.tick(…)` and test/inbox.test.ts's clock helper) get `// retired-name-ok: node:test mock clock` lines. Legacy readers use the guard's existing exemptions: `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines, and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions. Add no new mechanism.
- Run the retired-names guard and fix what it reports. A hit inside a legacy reader that must keep an old name (the `tick_*` event-type table, the `ticks`/`lastTickEndedAt` state-key map, the legacy `Tick:` trailer parser) gets the guard's own exemption (its allowlist or per-line marker), not a rename.

**Files touched.** src/pi/*.ts, src/agent/**/*.ts, src/pi-extension/*.ts, the remaining stragglers, the alias declarations across src/run/, src/history/, src/events/, src/files/, src/scheduling/, src/budget/, src/prompt/ and test/fixtures/orchestrator-fixtures.ts, and test/retired-names.test.ts.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test` lists none of this series' old names.
- `grep -rnE '[Tt]ick[A-Z]|[a-z0-9]Tick|TICK_' src test` lists only `backtick*`, `nextTick`, `processTicksAndRejections`, sites the retired-names guard exempts (the legacy readers), and the retired-names list itself.
- test/retired-names.test.ts holds the `run` family, including the `identifiers` list, and passes; adding `type TickResult = 1;` or `const cmdRun = 1;` to any src/ module makes it fail (check locally, do not commit).
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code cleanup, part 1/7: Rename notebook to notes and the initial prompt to the brief text in code (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires Plain terms code run 20/20 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names"; touches src/brief/ + src/init/ + src/prompt/ + src/run/run-prompt.ts + src/inbox/inbox-submit.ts + src/cli/brief-command.ts + src/ui/tui/ + comments naming the notebook + their tests)

**Goal.** Code says "notes" for a role's scratch file and names the project description after the brief: `readBriefText`, `editBriefText`, `replaceBriefText`, `BRIEF_TEXT_MAX_CHARS` and `briefText`. No identifier, comment or test title says "notebook" or "initial prompt".

**Approach.**
- Rules for this part:
  - Leave record prose alone: do not edit BUGS.md, PLANS.md, QUESTIONS.md, PLANS-DONE.md, BUGS-FIXED.md or any `plans/*.md`, even for the paths this part moves. Their old names are correct as written: finished entries record files as they were, and open plans name both sides of the moves they describe. This rule was added 2026-10-19 by user, after a sweep through them got Plain terms code runner part 1/14 rejected five times. The pre-queue self-check no longer lists these files; a review objection asking for them to be swept is outside this part's scope, so say so in RISK.
  - Glossary: "notes" replaces "notebook" and "brief" replaces "initial prompt" (plans/terminology.md "Glossary" and "Code names").
  - In code, `brief` already names the brief file's name (`const brief = briefState?.file` in src/run/run-prompt.ts, the `brief` parameter of `buildDirectorPrompt`), and `readBrief()` returns `{ file, prompt }`. So the initial prompt's text becomes `briefText`, never a bare `brief`, which would shadow or collide.
  - Serialized names and markers stay: the `<!-- tumwater:prompt:start -->`/`end` markers and the `PROMPT_START`/`PROMPT_END` constants, the `--clear-notes` flag, `state/notes/` paths, and `role --json`'s `notes` key. User-visible strings were Plain terms text's; leave string literals alone.
  - Legacy readers keep old names on purpose; rename nothing inside them (`normalizeLegacyEvent`'s tables, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES`, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, and fixtures that write old names on purpose).
  - Comments and test titles follow the glossary. Leave quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles (for example PLANS.md "Role notebook"), `plans/*.md` names and commit subjects (`tumwater(operator): Edit initial prompt`) alone (test/plan-citations.test.ts). Rewrap comment lines past 100 columns (test/comment-width.test.ts).
  - Exports used outside this part's files keep a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen, only while another file still names the old name. This part migrates every user, so it should end with none (test/exports.test.ts).
- src/brief/brief.ts: `readInitialPrompt` → `readBriefText`, `replaceInitialPrompt` → `replaceBriefText`, `INITIAL_PROMPT_MAX_CHARS` → `BRIEF_TEXT_MAX_CHARS`, and the `initialPrompt` parameters of `managedSections`, `readmeTemplate` and `briefTemplate` → `briefText`. src/brief/brief-edit.ts: `editInitialPrompt` → `editBriefText`. Migrate uses in src/init/init.ts, src/inbox/inbox-submit.ts (`DIRECTOR_PROMPT_MAX_CHARS = BRIEF_TEXT_MAX_CHARS`), src/cli/brief-command.ts and src/run/run-prompt.ts.
- src/prompt/prompt.ts: the `initialPrompt` member of the prompt-input interface, `sharedPreamble(initialPrompt, …)` and `buildDirectorPrompt`'s `initialPrompt` parameter → `briefText`, with every use, including src/run/run-prompt.ts's local `initialPrompt` → `briefText`.
- notebook: test/role-view.test.ts's local `notebookAt` → `notesAt`. `git mv test/tui-notebook.test.ts test/tui-notes.test.ts`, then check `docs/invariants.md` and DEVELOPMENT.md for a citation of the old name. Convert "notebook" in comments and test titles across src/ and test/ ("the role's notebook" → "the role's notes"; "the notebook view" → "the notes view"): src/ui/tui/tui-keys.ts, tui-pane.ts, src/paths.ts, src/roles/role-view.ts, src/agent/role-notes-write.ts, src/agent/run-agent.ts, src/agent/agent-backend.ts, src/cli/cli-query-commands.ts and the rest that `grep -rniw 'notebook' src test` lists.
- Finish with `grep -rniE 'notebook|initial[- ]?prompt|INITIAL_PROMPT' src test`, which may list only string literals Plain terms text deliberately kept, quoted titles and commit subjects, and legacy readers.

**Files touched.** src/brief/brief.ts, src/brief/brief-edit.ts, src/init/init.ts, src/inbox/inbox-submit.ts, src/cli/brief-command.ts, src/prompt/prompt.ts, src/run/run-prompt.ts, comment-only files the notebook grep lists (src/ui/tui/, src/agent/, src/paths.ts, src/roles/role-view.ts, src/cli/cli-query-commands.ts, …), test/tui-notes.test.ts (renamed), test/role-view.test.ts, test/brief*.test.ts, test/init*.test.ts, test/prompt*.test.ts.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `readBriefText`, `editBriefText`, `replaceBriefText` and `BRIEF_TEXT_MAX_CHARS` are declared, and none of `readInitialPrompt`, `editInitialPrompt`, `replaceInitialPrompt`, `INITIAL_PROMPT_MAX_CHARS` or an `initialPrompt` identifier remains in src/ or test/.
- test/tui-notes.test.ts exists and test/tui-notebook.test.ts does not.
- The grep in the last Approach bullet lists only the exceptions named there.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code cleanup, part 2/7: Rename custom-loop and role-id names in code (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 1/7 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names" and "Role names"; touches src/config/ + src/run/telemetry-digest.ts + src/run/run-prompt.ts + comments naming the dry or telemetry roles + their tests + test/retired-names.test.ts)

**Goal.** Code names custom roles as custom roles (`CustomRole`, `customRoleNames`, `CUSTOM_ROLE_KEYS`) and names the renamed roles by their new ids: `selfcheck-digest.ts`, `selfcheckDigest`, `SELFCHECK_DIGEST_DAYS` and dedupe-named test locals.

**Approach.**
- Rules for this part:
  - Leave record prose alone: do not edit BUGS.md, PLANS.md, QUESTIONS.md, PLANS-DONE.md, BUGS-FIXED.md or any `plans/*.md`, even for the paths this part moves. Their old names are correct as written: finished entries record files as they were, and open plans name both sides of the moves they describe. This rule was added 2026-10-19 by user, after a sweep through them got Plain terms code runner part 1/14 rejected five times. The pre-queue self-check no longer lists these files; a review objection asking for them to be swept is outside this part's scope, so say so in RISK.
  - Glossary: plans/terminology.md "Code names" rows "customLoop(s)" and "dry, telemetry"; "Role names" for the ids.
  - The legacy config key `customLoops` and the legacy role ids `dry` and `telemetry` stay where they are aliases: `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `normalizeLegacyEvent`'s tables, and fixtures that deliberately write old ids. Rename nothing inside them; the retired-names guard exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, `legacy`-prefixed identifiers and `retired-name-ok` lines or regions.
  - Keep "telemetry" in its generic sense ("prompt-token telemetry", claude's `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` env var, the `plans/telemetry-role.md` file name), "dry run"/`--dry-run`/`dryRun`/`DRY_RUN_FLAG`, and quoted PLANS.md/BUGS.md titles and commit subjects (`tumwater(telemetry)` in git history greps is a legacy reader).
  - Rewrap comment lines past 100 columns (test/comment-width.test.ts). Exports used elsewhere need no alias: migrate every user in this part.
- customLoop: in src/config/config-schema.ts, `interface CustomLoop` → `CustomRole`; `customLoopNames` → `customRoleNames` and `CUSTOM_LOOP_KEYS` → `CUSTOM_ROLE_KEYS` wherever declared; any remaining `customLoops` binding that is not the legacy key's alias handling → `customRoles`. Plain terms commands renamed the config field itself. The test role names `my-custom-loop`, `custom-loop` and `myloop` in config tests → `my-custom-role`, `custom-role` and `myrole`, unless a test is pinning the legacy key.
- Role ids: `git mv src/run/telemetry-digest.ts src/run/selfcheck-digest.ts` and `test/telemetry-digest.test.ts` → `test/selfcheck-digest.test.ts`; `telemetryDigest` → `selfcheckDigest` and `TELEMETRY_DIGEST_DAYS` → `SELFCHECK_DIGEST_DAYS`, with the import in src/run/run-prompt.ts. Update any docs/invariants.md or DEVELOPMENT.md citation of the old path in this part (test/invariants-doc.test.ts fails on a missing cited path). Test locals: `dryRow` (test/status-render.test.ts) → `dedupeRow`, `dryFailedAt` (an orchestrator e2e test) → `dedupeFailedAt`, any `dryRuns`/`dryTicks` → `dedupeRuns`, and marker files such as `dry-reviewing` → `dedupe-reviewing` when the test's role is now `dedupe`.
- Comments naming the roles (about 45 "telemetry" and 28 "dry" comment lines today): "the telemetry role" → "the selfcheck role"; role lists such as "(organize, clean, dry, perf, …)" → "dedupe"; `tumwater(telemetry)` in comments → `tumwater(selfcheck)`, except where the comment describes the legacy match.
- In test/retired-names.test.ts, remove `CustomLoop`, `customLoopNames` and `CUSTOM_LOOP_KEYS` from the `runner` family's `allow` list (Plain terms code runner put them there until this part), keeping `customLoops`, the live legacy key. The guard then fails if they come back.
- Finish with `grep -rnE '[Cc]ustomLoop|CUSTOM_LOOP|[Tt]elemetry[A-Z_]|TELEMETRY_' src test` and `grep -rnwE 'dry|telemetry' src test`, and check each hit against the keep list above.

**Files touched.** src/config/config-schema.ts and the src/config/ files declaring or using `customLoopNames`/`CUSTOM_LOOP_KEYS`, src/run/selfcheck-digest.ts (renamed), src/run/run-prompt.ts, comment-only files the role-id grep lists, test/selfcheck-digest.test.ts (renamed), test/config*.test.ts, test/status-render.test.ts, test/orchestrator*.e2e.test.ts, test/retired-names.test.ts (`allow` entries only).

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `CustomRole`, `customRoleNames`, `CUSTOM_ROLE_KEYS`, `selfcheckDigest` and `SELFCHECK_DIGEST_DAYS` are declared; src/run/selfcheck-digest.ts and test/selfcheck-digest.test.ts exist and the telemetry-digest files do not.
- The two greps in the last Approach bullet list only the exempt legacy readers and the generic senses named there.
- Config files using the legacy `customLoops` key still load (their existing alias tests pass unchanged).
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code cleanup, part 3/7: Rename the backend selector types and helpers in config and agent and pi (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 2/7 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names" and "Commands and config"; touches src/config/ + src/agent/ + src/pi/ + their tests)

**Goal.** The code that names which backend runs a role, pi or claude, says "backend" instead of "agent": `BackendId`, `BACKEND_IDS`, `DEFAULT_BACKEND`, `resolveBackendBin` and so on. Deprecated aliases stay for the callers part 4/7 migrates.

**Approach.**
- Rules for this part:
  - plans/terminology.md "Code names" row "agent": rename only "agent" meaning the backend selector (pi/claude). "Agent" meaning the model or process doing the work stays: `runAgent`, `AgentRunSpec`, `AgentInvocation`, `AgentExitInfo`, `AgentExitClassification`, `AgentBackend` and `registerAgentBackend` (an agent's backend), `foldAgentCommitsSince`, pi's protocol events `agent_start`/`agent_end` and `agentStart`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, `piAgentDir`/`agentDir`/`getAgentDir`, `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_*`, `AGENT_WRAPPER_RAN`, `onAgentWarning`, and everything about the `AGENTS.md` file (`shouldAppendAgents`). "Agent run" (one invocation) stays.
  - Legacy config keys stay where they are aliases: `agent`, `agents`, `agentBin` and `piArgs` in `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` (src/config/config-aliases.ts) and the code that drops or maps them (`dropAgentBin`, a `raw.agents` read). Rename nothing inside legacy readers; the retired-names guard exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, `legacy`-prefixed identifiers and `retired-name-ok` lines or regions.
  - Serialized names were renamed by Plain terms commands and scripting (`backend`, `backends`, `budget.backend`); do not touch string literals.
  - A bare `agent`/`agents` binding that holds a backend id → `backend`/`backends`, never shadowing an existing binding.
  - Comments: "the role's agent (pi or claude)" → "the role's backend"; leave "agent" meaning the model at work. Rewrap comment lines past 100 columns (test/comment-width.test.ts).
  - An export used outside this part's files keeps a two-line alias, `/** @deprecated Use NewName. */` on its own line above `export const OldName = NewName;` (`export type` for a type). Never write it on one line: test/exports.test.ts skips lines starting `/**`, so a dead one-line alias would linger unseen. A new name needs a user outside its own file in the same part (its test counts), or test/exports.test.ts fails. Members (interface fields, methods, parameters) get no alias: rename all their uses in this part, even outside these directories. Delete any alias no other file names (test/exports.test.ts).
- Renames, with aliases where callers outside src/config, src/agent and src/pi remain:
  - src/config/config-schema.ts: `AGENT_IDS` → `BACKEND_IDS`, `AgentId` → `BackendId`, `AgentConfig` → `BackendConfig` (if Plain terms commands did not already rename them).
  - src/config/model-selector.ts: `isAgentId` → `isBackendId`, and `routeModel`'s `configAgent` parameter → `configBackend`.
  - src/config/config-keys.ts: `AGENT_KEYS` → `BACKEND_KEYS`.
  - src/config/config-views.ts: `resolvedAgentConfig` → `resolvedBackendConfig`, `agentQualifiedSelector` → `backendQualifiedSelector`, `agentDefault` → `backendDefault`.
  - src/config/config-live.ts: `resolveAgentBin` → `resolveBackendBin`, `findAgentBinary` → `findBackendBinary`, `agentMissingMessage` → `backendMissingMessage`, and the local `prevAgents` → `prevBackends`.
  - src/config/config.ts and config-write.ts: `collapseAgentAliases` → `collapseBackendAliases`.
  - src/agent/agent-backend.ts: `DEFAULT_AGENT` → `DEFAULT_BACKEND`, `AgentBinConfig` → `BackendBinConfig`, `agentBackend(id)` → `backendById(id)`, `agentSessionResumable` → `backendSessionResumable`, `ResolvedAgentBin` → `ResolvedBackendBin`.
  - src/agent/claude/claude-backend.ts and src/config/model-selector.ts: `AGENT_DEFAULT_MODELS` → `BACKEND_DEFAULT_MODELS`. src/agent/claude/claude-backend.ts and src/pi/pi-backend.ts: `agentBaseEnv` → `backendBaseEnv`.
  - src/pi/pi-bin.ts: `agentBinSourceLabel`/`agentBinSourceLabelFor` → `backendBinSourceLabel`/`backendBinSourceLabelFor`, `AgentBinSource` → `BackendBinSource`, `agentBinConfigKey` → `backendBinConfigKey`, `agentBinEnv` → `backendBinEnv`, `agentsInUse` → `backendsInUse`.
  - Also rename bare backend-id bindings and comments in these three directories (src/config has about 20 such declarations, src/agent 13, src/pi 11).
- Tests: test/config*.test.ts, test/pi-bin.test.ts (about 30 lines), test/session-ledger.test.ts, test/claude-*.test.ts, test/agent-backend.test.ts and test/model-selector*.test.ts.

**Files touched.** src/config/*.ts except config-aliases.ts's legacy table, src/agent/**/*.ts, src/pi/*.ts, and the tests listed above.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- The new names above are declared; each old name exists only as a deprecated alias that some file outside src/config, src/agent and src/pi still uses.
- `grep -rnE '\b(AgentId|AGENT_IDS|isAgentId|DEFAULT_AGENT|AgentConfig|AgentBinConfig|AGENT_KEYS|resolveAgentBin|findAgentBinary|agentsInUse|collapseAgentAliases)\b' src/config src/agent src/pi` lists only the alias lines.
- A config using the legacy `agent`/`agents`/`agentBin` keys still loads (the alias tests pass unchanged).
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code cleanup, part 4/7: Migrate the backend selector callers and retire the cleanup names (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 3/7 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Code names" and "Guards"; touches src/doctor/ + src/gates/ + src/roles/ + src/prompt/ + src/ui/ + src/run/ + src/runner/ + src/status/ + src/cli/ + src/review/ + src/paths.ts + their tests + test/retired-names.test.ts)

**Goal.** Every caller uses the backend names from part 3/7, the deprecated aliases are gone, and test/retired-names.test.ts lists the old names of all the cleanup families, so the code rename is complete.

**Approach.**
- Rules for this part:
  - Rename only "agent" meaning the backend selector (pi/claude), as in part 3/7. Keep `runAgent`, `AgentRunSpec`, `AgentInvocation`, `AgentExit*`, `AgentBackend`, `registerAgentBackend`, `foldAgentCommitsSince`, pi protocol names, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, `AGENTS.md` handling, and "agent run".
  - Legacy readers keep old names on purpose (`CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES`, src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `normalizeLegacyEvent`'s tables, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` helpers, and fixtures that write old names). The retired-names guard exempts them through `LEGACY_FILES`, `legacy`-prefixed identifiers and `retired-name-ok` lines or regions; never add a second mechanism.
  - Members (fields, methods, parameters) are renamed with all their uses. Never shadow an existing binding. Rewrap comment lines past 100 columns (test/comment-width.test.ts).
- Callers to migrate:
  - src/doctor/ (doctor.ts, doctor-checks.ts, doctor-model-checks.ts): `checkAgentBinary` → `checkBackendBinary`, `agentBinaryCheck` → `backendBinaryCheck`, plus uses of `agentsInUse`, `isAgentId`, `agentQualifiedSelector` and `agentBaseEnv`.
  - src/gates/ (readiness.ts, startup-gate.ts), src/roles/ (role-render.ts's `agentDefault` function → `backendDefault`), src/ui/badges.ts's local `agentDefault` → `backendDefault`, src/status/, src/cli/, src/review/ (`agentSessionResumable`) and src/prompt/: migrate.
  - Members holding a backend id: `RunPromptInput.agent` (src/run/run-prompt.ts) → `backend`; `RoleRunner.runPrompt(agent?)` and `RunnerRunContext.runPrompt(agent?)` parameters → `backend`; `buildDirectorPrompt`'s backend parameter; `nativeLogPath(root, role, agent)` in src/paths.ts → `backend`. Rename each with all its uses.
- Tests: test/doctor-checks.test.ts (about 23 lines), test/doctor-model-checks.test.ts, test/run-resume.test.ts, test/gui-operator.test.ts, test/gui-client-settings.test.ts, test/status-data-budget.test.ts, test/runner-pi*.test.ts, test/review-followup.test.ts, test/provider-lease.test.ts, test/pi.test.ts and test/fakes/fake-pi.ts.
- Delete every alias part 3/7 added (`grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test` must list none from this series).
- Extend the guard in test/retired-names.test.ts (shape `{ family, words, fileWords, allow }`, plus the optional exact-name `identifiers` field Plain terms code run 20/20 added):
  - a `notes` family: `words: ["notebook", "notebooks"]`, `fileWords: ["notebook"]`;
  - a `brief` family: `identifiers: ["initialPrompt", "readInitialPrompt", "editInitialPrompt", "replaceInitialPrompt", "INITIAL_PROMPT_MAX_CHARS"]`;
  - a `role-ids` family: `identifiers: ["telemetryDigest", "TELEMETRY_DIGEST_DAYS", "dryRow", "dryFailedAt"]`. Not the words `dry` or `telemetry`, which still mean a dry run, generic telemetry and `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`;
  - a `backend` family: `identifiers: ["AgentId", "AGENT_IDS", "isAgentId", "DEFAULT_AGENT", "AgentConfig", "AgentBinConfig", "AGENT_KEYS", "resolveAgentBin", "findAgentBinary", "checkAgentBinary", "agentMissingMessage", "agentsInUse", "collapseAgentAliases", "resolvedAgentConfig", "agentQualifiedSelector", "AGENT_DEFAULT_MODELS", "agentBaseEnv", "agentBinSourceLabel", "agentSessionResumable"]`.
  Never list `customLoops`, `agent`, `agents`, `agentBin`, `dry` or `telemetry`: they are live legacy keys and ids. Legacy readers use the guard's existing exemptions: `LEGACY_FILES`, identifiers whose first word is `legacy`, `// retired-name-ok: <reason>` lines, and `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions. Add no new mechanism.
- Confirm the guard now covers all five code families (team, merge, runner, run, cleanup). If an earlier family's last part missed an entry its own entry named, add it here.

**Files touched.** The caller files above, the alias declarations in src/config/, src/agent/ and src/pi/, the tests listed above, and test/retired-names.test.ts.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `grep -rn '@deprecated Use' src test` prints nothing.
- `grep -rnE '\b(AgentId|AGENT_IDS|isAgentId|DEFAULT_AGENT|AgentConfig|AgentBinConfig|AGENT_KEYS|resolveAgentBin|findAgentBinary|checkAgentBinary|agentsInUse)\b' src test` lists only the retired-names list and exempt legacy readers.
- test/retired-names.test.ts passes with the new families; adding `const readInitialPrompt = 1;` or `const notebookPath = 1;` to a src/ module makes it fail (check locally, do not commit).
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code cleanup, part 5/7: Scan every module with the vocabulary guard and fix the first half of src (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 4/7 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Guards" and "Wording rules"; touches test/vocabulary.test.ts + test/helpers/legacy-files.ts + test/retired-names.test.ts + string literals in src/agent/ through src/init/ + src/*.ts)

**Goal.** test/vocabulary.test.ts scans every src/ module, not only those with the `// vocabulary: plain` header, except the directories listed in a new pending set. This part cleans the first half of src/ (agent through init, plus the root modules) and removes them from that set.

**Approach.**
- Guard change in test/vocabulary.test.ts:
  - Add `PENDING_VOCABULARY_DIRS`, a set of src/ directory paths whose header-less modules the guard still skips. Change the guard's single opt-in test, `optedIn(text)` (Plain terms groundwork put it in one function for this flip), to take the module path as well, and return true when the module has the header or lies outside the pending set. Modules that carry the header keep being scanned wherever they live.
  - Every other module under src/ is scanned with the existing rules (string literals and template-literal text, word-bounded, case-insensitive, a line ending `// vocabulary-ok: <reason>` exempt).
  - The set starts as the second half of src/: `src/merge`, `src/operator`, `src/orchestrator`, `src/pi`, `src/pi-extension`, `src/process`, `src/prompt`, `src/redeploy`, `src/report`, `src/review`, `src/roles`, `src/run`, `src/runner`, `src/scheduling`, `src/status`, `src/team`, `src/text`, `src/ui`, `src/verdict`. Part 6/7 empties it.
  - Add a test that fails when a set entry names a directory that does not exist, so the set cannot rot.
- Legacy readers must name old words on purpose, and they need the same exemption in both guards:
  - Move test/retired-names.test.ts's `LEGACY_FILES` list into a small shared helper, test/helpers/legacy-files.ts, so a test file never imports another test file (that would register its tests twice). Import the helper from both guards.
  - Make the vocabulary guard skip the `LEGACY_FILES` modules and honor the retired-names guard's `retired-name-ok:start`/`end` regions and `// retired-name-ok:` lines as well as its own `// vocabulary-ok:`. One marker then serves both guards: `normalizeLegacyEvent`'s tables, the state loaders' legacy-key maps, the `legacyLand*` helpers, src/orchestrator/startup-migrations.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts, `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` in src/config/config-aliases.ts, and src/roles/legacy-role-ids.ts.
  - Pin both behaviors with a guard test.
- Then fix every hit the guard reports in src/agent, src/backlog, src/baseline, src/brief, src/budget, src/build, src/change, src/cli, src/concurrency, src/config, src/doctor, src/events, src/failure, src/files, src/gates, src/git, src/gui, src/history, src/inbox, src/init and the root modules (src/cli.ts, src/paths.ts, src/version.ts, …):
  - User-visible text a reader can see (CLI output, errors, warnings, agent prompts): reword per plans/terminology.md "Glossary" and "Wording rules".
  - Machine names that must stay: the `tumwater(operator):` prefix, hidden-alias argv (`"tick"`, `"run"`), git ref and directory names of legacy layouts, and env vars of other tools. These get `// vocabulary-ok: <reason>` at the end of the line.
  - Internal strings no user sees (cache keys, log tags, test seams): rename to plain words when nothing persisted depends on them; otherwise mark them `vocabulary-ok`.
- To list the hits, run the guard (`npm run test` filtered to vocabulary, as DEVELOPMENT.md describes the runner's file filter) and work directory by directory. If this half reports far more than about 300 lines, stop at a directory boundary, add the untouched directories back to `PENDING_VOCABULARY_DIRS`, and say so in the commit message; part 6/7 starts from whatever the set holds.

**Files touched.** test/vocabulary.test.ts; test/helpers/legacy-files.ts (new) and test/retired-names.test.ts (imports it); string literals in src/agent/ … src/init/ and the root src/*.ts modules. Tests asserting reworded output in the same directories (for example test/cli*.test.ts and test/doctor*.test.ts).

**Acceptance criteria.**
- test/vocabulary.test.ts scans every module outside `PENDING_VOCABULARY_DIRS` and passes; the set holds only second-half directories (plus any first-half ones this part's commit message names).
- Each surviving retired word in a scanned module sits on a `// vocabulary-ok: <reason>` line or in an exempt legacy reader.
- Adding `say("the fleet is idle")` to an unmarked module in src/cli/ makes the guard fail (check locally, do not commit).
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code cleanup, part 6/7: Fix the second half of src for the vocabulary guard (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 5/7 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Guards" and "Wording rules"; touches test/vocabulary.test.ts + string literals in the directories still in PENDING_VOCABULARY_DIRS)

**Goal.** `PENDING_VOCABULARY_DIRS` is empty: every src/ module passes the vocabulary guard, with or without a header.

**Approach.**
- Fix every hit the guard reports in the directories `PENDING_VOCABULARY_DIRS` still holds: the second half of src/ (merge … verdict, including src/ui/ and its gui/ and tui/ subdirectories), plus any first-half directory part 5/7 handed over. Apply the same treatment as part 5/7:
  - Reword user-visible text per plans/terminology.md "Glossary" and "Wording rules".
  - Mark machine names that must stay with `// vocabulary-ok: <reason>` (the `tumwater(operator):` prefix, hidden-alias argv, legacy layout names, other tools' env vars).
  - Rename or mark internal strings.
  - Legacy readers stay exempt through the shared retired-names exemption.
- The dashboard's gui-client modules are browser code inside String.raw templates, which the guard reads as template text. A code name inside the browser code that still trips it (a DOM id, a CSS class, a local) is renamed to a plain word, checking uniqueness across the concatenated client modules. An end-of-line `// vocabulary-ok:` there is a browser-side JS comment and is allowed.
- Remove each directory from `PENDING_VOCABULARY_DIRS` as it passes, then delete the set and its existence test once it is empty, leaving the guard's header rule for part 7/7.
- Update tests that assert reworded output in the same directories.

**Files touched.** test/vocabulary.test.ts; string literals in src/merge/, src/operator/, src/orchestrator/, src/pi/, src/pi-extension/, src/process/, src/prompt/, src/redeploy/, src/report/, src/review/, src/roles/, src/run/, src/runner/, src/scheduling/, src/status/, src/team/, src/text/, src/ui/ and src/verdict/ (only those with hits); their tests.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `PENDING_VOCABULARY_DIRS` no longer exists, and the guard scans every src/ module and passes.
- Each surviving retired word in src/ string literals sits on a `// vocabulary-ok: <reason>` line or in an exempt legacy reader.
- No user-visible behavior changes beyond wording: every test passes, and any changed assertion changed only reworded text.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Plain terms code cleanup, part 7/7: Make the vocabulary guard cover all of src and drop the opt-in headers (planned 2026-10-16 by user; requires part 6/7 landed; design in plans/terminology.md "Guards"; touches test/vocabulary.test.ts + every src/ module carrying a vocabulary header)

**Goal.** Mostly mechanical. The vocabulary guard has no opt-in: it always scans every src/ module. The `// vocabulary: plain` header lines are deleted, since they no longer mean anything.

**Approach.**
- test/vocabulary.test.ts: remove the header requirement and any remaining scope logic (`optedIn` goes away), so the target is every `.ts`/`.tsx` module under src/. Replace the groundwork test "with no `// vocabulary: plain` header anywhere in src/, the guard passes" with one that a header-less module is scanned. Keep the word list, the word-bounded case-insensitive match, the string-literal and template-text walk (never `${…}` expressions), the `// vocabulary-ok: <reason>` line exemption, and the shared legacy-reader exemption from part 5/7. Update the file's header comment to say the guard covers all of src/ and that `vocabulary-ok` is the only escape.
- Delete every `// vocabulary: plain` line in src/: `grep -rln '^// vocabulary: plain' src` lists them, one line per module, up to about 300. Change nothing else in those files.
- Features keep landing while this series runs, so run the guard and fix any hit introduced since part 6/7 the same way: reword, or mark `vocabulary-ok` with a reason.
- docs/glossary.md and DEVELOPMENT.md may describe the opt-in header. Update their sentence on how the guard is scoped, and nothing else in them.

**Files touched.** test/vocabulary.test.ts; every src/ module with a `// vocabulary: plain` header (one deleted line each); any module with a newly introduced hit; the guard sentence in docs/glossary.md and DEVELOPMENT.md if they describe the header.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `grep -rn 'vocabulary: plain' src test` prints nothing, apart from a negative-case fixture inside test/vocabulary.test.ts if it keeps one.
- Adding `say("the fleet is idle")` to any src/ module without a `vocabulary-ok` marker makes the guard fail (check locally, do not commit).
- The guard's own tests pin the new scope: a module without any header is scanned.
- `npm run test` passes.

### Backend/model split, part 5/5: Retire the namespace spellings as load errors and drop the scalar budget backend (planned 2026-10-19 by user, split 2026-10-19 by the plan role; requires parts 3/5–4/5 landed; touches src/config/model-selector.ts src/config/config-views.ts src/config/config-fallbacks.ts src/config/config-validation.ts src/config/config-aliases.ts src/status/status-budget.ts src/ui/badges.ts docs/config.md docs/backends.md docs/glossary.md test/model-selector.test.ts test/config-validation.test.ts test/config-validation-model.test.ts test/config-views.test.ts test/config-aliases.test.ts test/badges.test.ts)

**Needs review 2026-10-19 by plan: merging this makes the live tumwater.json's `claude/…` model ids a load error, so the operator first migrates it — `model` loses the namespace (`"claude-sonnet-5-5"`, `"strong": "claude-opus-5-5"`) under the existing `"backend": "claude"`, and the pi fallback becomes `{ "backend": "pi", "model": "qwenrunner/qwen3.8-27b" }` (valid once parts 1/5-2/5 land) — then removes this note**

**Goal.** A model id never names a backend: each retired spelling fails the load with a message naming the exact edit (the operator chose no shims), and the fleet-wide scalar `BudgetSlice.backend` goes. Series goal and siblings: part 1/5.

**Approach.**
- `routeModel` (src/config/model-selector.ts) loses rule 1 (`isAgentId(provider)`) and rule 3a (`startsWith("claude-")`): the backend is the explicit backend ?? the top-level `backend` ?? `"pi"`, and claude/opencode take the id verbatim on both paths. `seamKeyedFallbackProvider` (src/config/config-fallbacks.ts) follows the same rule; a fallback step with no `backend` inherits its tier primary's resolved backend (the tier entry's, else the top level's). `seamAgent` keeps its `agent` read; its `isAgentId(seam.provider)` branch goes once no resolved seam carries a namespace provider. `AGENT_IDS`' doc comment drops "doubles as the selector provider namespace".
- `validateConfig`'s raw pass rejects, each naming the value and the fix: a selector whose first segment is a backend id (`claude/claude-opus-5-5` → write `backend: "claude"` beside `model: "claude-opus-5-5"`); a bare `claude-…` id resolved to pi (add `backend: "claude"`, or write `anthropic/claude-…` to keep it on pi); `opencode/…` resolved to pi (write `backend: "opencode"`). Drop the `agent → backend` row from `CONFIG_KEY_RENAMES` (src/config/config-aliases.ts) so a top-level `agent` key is an unknown-key error naming `backend`; `agents → backends` stays.
- Delete `BudgetSlice.backend` (src/status/status-budget.ts, its interface field and `backend: cfg.backend ?? "pi"`); src/ui/badges.ts's `agentDefault` uses the constant `pi default`, and the test/badges.test.ts case passing `backend: "claude"` drops that field and asserts the new label.
- docs/config.md, docs/backends.md and docs/glossary.md drop part 3/5's "still load until part 5/5" sentences and the `agent → backend` rename rows; test/config-aliases.test.ts asserts the `agent` error.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `grep -rn 'isAgentId(provider)\|startsWith("claude-")' src` finds nothing; each retired spelling (`claude/<id>`, `opencode/<id>` under pi, bare `claude-…` under pi, top-level `agent`) fails `validateConfig` with a message naming the offending value and the edit.
- The migrated form of the team's config in the note above, loaded in a test, resolves `seamsInUse` to claude for every primary seam and `qwenrunner/qwen3.8-27b` on pi for the fallback.
- `backend: "claude"` with no `model` still resolves claude's three tier defaults and `CLAUDE_GATED_MODELS` still lists exactly those three.
- `BudgetSlice` has no `backend` field; `npm test` passes.

### A team start drops every `refs/tumwater/` pin whose commit is gone, so a disabled role's dangling pin no longer stops `git gc` until someone deletes it by hand (planned 2026-10-20 by the plan role; independent of every Planned entry: touches src/git/worktree.ts, src/runner/leftover.ts, src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts, test/worktree.test.ts and test/leftover.test.ts. The in-flight `tumwater doctor` "tumwater pins" entry edits only src/doctor/ and its tests, and reports what this sweep drops. The blocked Plain terms code parts reword comments in these files and rename no identifier this entry uses or adds)

**Goal.** A pin under `refs/tumwater/` whose commit is missing breaks every git command that walks all refs. `git gc`, and the `gc --auto` that commits trigger, exit 128 with `fatal: bad object <ref>`, so the repository stops being packed. Today the harness drops such a pin only when it trips over it. `checkoutDetached` (src/git/worktree.ts) drops one when a slot's `checkout --detach` fails on it. `dropDanglingPin` (src/runner/leftover.ts) drops a role's own merge pin when that role next runs. A rejected pin, a legacy landing pin, or the merge pin of a disabled or retired role stays until an operator runs `git update-ref -d`. Sweep them once at team start, before any run.

There is a second gap in the same place. `dropDanglingPin` deletes with `deleteRefIfAt` (`git update-ref -d <ref> <sha>`). In a scratch repo, that guarded form exited 1 (`cannot lock ref …: unable to resolve reference`) for a dangling ref held in `.git/packed-refs` and left the ref. The unguarded `git update-ref -d <ref>` removed it, and `git gc` then exited 0. The guarded form did delete a loose dangling ref. So a packed dangling merge pin survives every recovery, and each of the role's runs logs another "dropped merge pin" warning.

**Approach.**
- src/git/worktree.ts:
  - Give `logDroppedRef(root, ref)` a third parameter `why: string`. The event message becomes `dropped dangling ref ${ref} (<short sha>, object missing) ${why}`. `checkoutDetached` passes `"so a worktree checkout could proceed"`, so its message is unchanged.
  - Add `export async function dropDanglingTumwaterPins(root: string): Promise<string[]>` beside `removeLegacyLandWorktrees`. For each `{ ref, sha }` of `await refsUnder(root, "refs/tumwater/")` (src/git/git.ts) where `!(await commitExists(root, sha))`, it calls `logDroppedRef(root, ref, "at team start")` and then `await deleteRef(root, ref)`. It returns the dropped ref names in `refsUnder` order.
  - Use the unguarded `deleteRef`, as `checkoutDetached` does, because the guarded form cannot delete a packed dangling ref. The doc comment says so. It also says that the sweep runs before any run, while nothing else writes pins, and that refs outside `refs/tumwater/` are never touched.
- src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts (`runOrchestrator`): call `await dropDanglingTumwaterPins(root)` right after `await runStartupMigrations(root)`. Add a one-line comment: the `mergeRefs` migration has already moved legacy landing pins, it keeps a dangling one because `setRef` refuses a missing object, and the sweep drops what is left before any run.
  - A role whose dangling merge pin the sweep dropped then goes through `recoverLeftover`'s no-pin path at its next run. That is the same path a role takes after a merge deletes its pin.
  - Do not call the sweep from `runStartupMigrationsIfIdle` or src/cli/cli-start.ts: CLI readers do not change refs.
- src/runner/leftover.ts (`dropDanglingPin`): delete with `deleteRef(root, ref)` instead of `deleteRefIfAt(root, ref, sha)`. Add a doc-comment clause saying why. That was the file's only `deleteRefIfAt` call, so drop it from the import.

**Tests.**
- test/worktree.test.ts, after "ensureDetachedWorktree still throws on a dangling ref outside refs/tumwater/": add "dropDanglingTumwaterPins drops loose and packed pins naming missing commits and keeps live ones". Set up a `makeRepo()`:
  - Run `git update-ref refs/tumwater/rejected/bugfix HEAD`, then `git pack-refs --all`.
  - Append `${"2".repeat(40)} refs/tumwater/merge/retired` to `.git/packed-refs`.
  - Write a loose `.git/refs/tumwater/merge/feature-5` holding `"1".repeat(40)`.
  - The call returns `["refs/tumwater/merge/feature-5", "refs/tumwater/merge/retired"]`.
  - Afterwards `refsUnder(repo, "refs/tumwater/")` lists only `refs/tumwater/rejected/bugfix`, and `git gc -q` exits 0.
  - `readEvents(repo)` holds two `warning` events whose messages end `at team start`, with `ref` and `sha` set.
  - A second call returns `[]` and logs nothing more.
- test/leftover.test.ts, beside "pinnedRetrySha drops a pin whose commit is missing": add "a packed merge pin whose commit is missing is dropped too". Build a `makeRepo()`, run `git pack-refs --all`, and append `${"1".repeat(40)} ${mergeRefName(ROLE)}` to `.git/packed-refs`. Then `pinnedRetrySha(root, ROLE, "main", {})` returns null and `refSha(root, mergeRefName(ROLE))` is null afterwards. Before the change the ref survives, so the test fails then.
- The existing tests "ensureDetachedWorktree drops a dangling merge ref that makes `checkout --detach` exit 128" and "a pin whose commit is missing is dropped with a warning and nothing is queued" pass unchanged.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- At team start, before any run, every `refs/tumwater/` ref whose commit is missing is deleted, loose or packed. Each deletion logs one `warning` event naming the ref and sha. Live pins and refs outside `refs/tumwater/` are left alone.
- Leftover recovery deletes a packed dangling merge pin instead of warning on every run.
- A `checkoutDetached` drop logs the same message as before.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

### The TUI's Ctrl+R/Ctrl+V and the dashboard's Release and Move to top say when the entry is still held afterwards, as `tumwater plan|bug --release/--top` already do (planned 2026-10-20 by the plan role; independent of every Planned entry. Touches `releaseArmed` and `moveEntryToTop` in src/ui/tui/tui-pane-backlog.ts, `handleBacklogRelease` and `handleBacklogTop` in src/gui/gui-backlog-commands.ts, and the `entry-release`/`entry-top` actions in src/ui/gui/gui-client-boot.ts. Plain terms code run 7/20 and 15/20 later rename code in src/ui/gui/ and src/ui/tui/; this entry renames nothing)

**Goal.** The CLI's `releaseAndAnnounce` and `topAndAnnounce` (src/backlog/backlog-cli.ts) now read `backlogHolds(root)` after the commit. They print `stillHeldNote(hold)` for an entry that is still held, and a release wakes no role. The two other surfaces for the same actions still report success that no role acts on. The TUI's Ctrl+R flashes `released <kind> #<n>: <title>` and calls `requestWake` unconditionally. Its Ctrl+V flashes `moved <kind> #<n> to the top: <title>`. `handleBacklogRelease` wakes the kind's role unconditionally, and the dashboard toasts "— feature will pick it up". `handleBacklogTop` answers `moved_to_top`, and the dashboard toasts "— feature takes it next". This happens even when the entry is still held by a Needs-review/Needs-replan line, by the other kind of lifted note, or by an unmerged "requires part N/M landed" prerequisite, and `assignNext` skips such an entry. All three surfaces should name the remaining hold in `stillHeldNote` wording.

**Approach.**
- src/ui/tui/tui-pane-backlog.ts: import `backlogHolds` and `stillHeldNote` from `../../backlog/backlog-eligibility.js`. In `releaseArmed`, after `session.commitBacklogEdit` for `status === "released"`, take `const holds = backlogHolds(session.root)` and `const hold = (kind === "bug" ? holds.bugs : holds.plans)[position - 1] ?? null`. This is the CLI's lookup; a release never moves an entry. Call `requestWake` only when `hold === null`. The released flash appends `` — ${stillHeldNote(hold)}`` when the hold is non-null. In `moveEntryToTop`, after the `moved_to_top` commit, take the hold at index `0` of the matching array and append the same tail to the moved flash. Other outcomes and their flashes do not change.
- src/gui/gui-backlog-commands.ts: import the same two functions. In `handleBacklogRelease`'s `released` branch, read the hold the same way after the commit. Call `requestWake` only when it is null. Add `heldNote: stillHeldNote(hold)` to the 200 payload only when it is non-null, using the conditional spread that `handleBacklogCancel` uses for `releasedNote`. Do the same in `handleBacklogTop`'s `moved_to_top` branch, reading index 0 and with no wake, as now. Update both doc comments: a held entry wakes no role and carries `heldNote`.
- src/ui/gui/gui-client-boot.ts: in `entry-release`'s `released` branch, when `d.heldNote` is set, the toast reads `"Released “<title>” in <file> — " + d.heldNote + uncommittedTail(d)` instead of the "— feature will pick it up" clause. `entry-top`'s `moved_to_top` branch makes the same substitution for "— feature takes it next". When `heldNote` is absent, both toasts keep their current wording.
- docs/invariants.md: the backlog-edits sentence that says a release "commits `Release <kind>: <title>` and wakes the kind's role" adds "unless the entry stays held, which every surface reports with `stillHeldNote` and which wakes no role". docs/cli.md: in the TUI backlog-pane sentence about Ctrl+R and Ctrl+V, and in the dashboard Release/Move to top wording, add "(a held entry says so and, on release, wakes no one)".

**Tests.**
- test/tui-keys.test.ts, beside "backlog Ctrl+R arms, then a second Ctrl+R releases the selected refused bug": a new test seeds `### Export series, part 1/2: a (planned 2026-10-01)` and then `### Export series, part 2/2: b (planned 2026-10-02; requires part 1/2 landed)` whose body carries a Refused note. It selects plan 2 and presses Ctrl+R twice. The Refused line is gone from PLANS.md, the flash matches `/released plan #2: .* — still held \[blocked: requires Export series 1\/2\]/`, and no wake marker exists at `wakeRequestPath(root)`. A second new test, beside "backlog Ctrl+V moves the selected plan to the head of its section", runs Ctrl+V on that same dependent part: the flash matches `/to the top: .* — still held \[blocked: requires/`. The existing Ctrl+R and Ctrl+V tests pass unchanged, so an unheld entry's flash has no `still held` and still writes the wake marker.
- test/gui-endpoints.test.ts, beside "handleBacklogRelease lifts the Refused note, wakes the kind's role, …": with the same seed, `handleBacklogRelease` for position 2 answers `status: "released"` with `heldNote` matching `/^still held \[blocked: requires Export series 1\/2\]/` and writes no wake marker. `handleBacklogTop` for position 2 answers `moved_to_top` with the same `heldNote`. The existing deepEqual payloads for unheld entries in both tests pass unchanged.
- test/gui-client-boot.test.ts, beside "entry-release posts the release at once for plans and bugs": capture the `postAction` callback and call it with `{ status: "released", heldNote: "still held [blocked: needs review]: …", committed: true }`. The returned toast contains the note and not "will pick it up". Without `heldNote` it contains "will pick it up". Make the same pair of checks for `entry-top` against "takes it next".

**Acceptance criteria.**
- Releasing a still-held entry from the TUI or the dashboard commits the edit, wakes no role, and reports the hold in `stillHeldNote` wording: in the TUI flash, and in the dashboard's `heldNote` field and toast.
- Moving a held entry to the top from either surface commits the move and reports the hold the same way.
- An entry that is eligible after the action gets the flash, payload, toast and wake it gets now.
- The CLI's `--release`/`--top` behavior does not change.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

### Kill orphans, part 1/2: the dashboard Health card's Kill orphans button runs `doctor --kill-orphans`, so an operator does not need a terminal to reap leaked processes (planned 2026-10-20 by the plan role; independent of every Planned entry. Touches src/doctor/doctor-orphans.ts, src/cli.ts, src/gui/gui-operator-commands.ts, src/gui/gui-endpoint-commands.ts, src/gui/gui-server.ts, src/ui/gui/gui-client-settings.ts, src/ui/gui/gui-client-boot.ts. Part 2/2 adds the TUI twin. Plain terms code run 7/20 later renames code in src/ui/gui/; this entry renames nothing)

**Goal.** `tumwater doctor --kill-orphans` kills the processes the orphans check fails on, and the check's detail names that command. The dashboard's Health card (Settings view) shows the same failing row but offers no way to act on it, so the operator has to switch to a terminal. Add a two-click Kill orphans button to the Health card. It runs the same `killOrphans`, toasts what was killed in the CLI's wording, and re-runs the checks.

**Approach.**
- src/doctor/doctor-orphans.ts: export the report type as `OrphanKillReport` and add `export function orphanKillLines(report: OrphanKillReport): string[]`. Move the CLI's wording into it unchanged: `could not scan the process table — <error>; nothing killed`; `killed pid <pid>` plus ` (+N descendant(s))` when there are descendants, then ` <command>`; `could not kill pid <pid>: <reason>`; and `no orphaned processes to kill` when both lists are empty. Import `plural` from src/text/phrases.ts, as src/cli.ts does.
- src/cli.ts: the `doctor --kill-orphans` branch prints `orphanKillLines(await killOrphans(root))` one line per `say`, then the blank line it prints now. CLI output does not change.
- src/gui/gui-operator-commands.ts: add `handleKillOrphans(req, res, root, kill = killOrphans)`. It follows `handleReclaim`'s body discipline (`readPostBody(req, res, "{}")`, body ignored) and answers `sendJson(res, 200, { ok: !("error" in report) && report.failed.length === 0, message: orphanKillLines(report).join("; ") })`. Re-export it from src/gui/gui-endpoint-commands.ts beside `handleReclaim`. Route it in src/gui/gui-server.ts as `"POST /api/kill-orphans"` beside `"POST /api/reclaim"`.
- src/ui/gui/gui-client-settings.ts: `buildSettingsView`'s doctorcard header gets `<button type='button' class='btn btn-sm' data-action='doctor-kill-orphans'>Kill orphans</button>` after Re-run. Add `const killSlot = confirmSlot(paintKillButton)` and a `killOrphansClick()`. The first click arms the slot and the button reads `Confirm kill`. A second click within the window disarms the slot, shows `showFlash("Killing orphaned processes…")`, posts `/api/kill-orphans`, and then shows `showFlash((d.ok ? "" : "error: ") + d.message)` and calls `fetchDoctor()`. A post failure flashes `"error: " + clientErrorMessage(err)`, the same as `testNotify`. `paintKillButton` sets the button's text from `killSlot.armed("orphans")`.
- src/ui/gui/gui-client-boot.ts: the Health card click listener that handles `doctor-rerun` also routes `button[data-action='doctor-kill-orphans']` to `killOrphansClick()`.
- src/doctor/doctor-orphans.ts: the fail detail's tail becomes ` — nothing reaps these; \`tumwater doctor --kill-orphans\` (or the dashboard Health card's Kill orphans) kills each with its descendants`. Update the expected detail strings in test/doctor-orphans.test.ts to match.
- docs/cli.md: in the Audit row's `doctor` text, add that the dashboard Health card's Kill orphans button does the same as `--kill-orphans` after a confirming second click.

**Tests.**
- test/doctor-orphans.test.ts: "orphanKillLines words a kill, a refusal, an empty report and an unreadable table". Cover a killed entry with 2 descendants, a killed entry with none, an EPERM refusal, `{ killed: [], failed: [] }`, and `{ error: "ps: not found" }`, each asserted as the exact lines.
- test/gui-endpoints.test.ts, beside the `handleReclaim` tests: "handleKillOrphans answers the kill's lines and ok". An injected `kill` resolving `{ killed: [{ pid: 4242, command: "node x", descendants: 1 }], failed: [] }` answers `{ ok: true, message: "killed pid 4242 (+1 descendant) node x" }`. One resolving `{ error: "boom" }` answers `ok: false` with the scan wording.
- test/gui-client-settings.test.ts, which already drives the settings card's `testNotify` (add `killOrphansClick` and `paintKillButton` to its extracted-names list beside `confirmRetire`): a single click on the Kill orphans button posts nothing, and two clicks post `/api/kill-orphans` once.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- The Health card shows a Kill orphans button. The first click only arms it. A second click within 5 s posts `/api/kill-orphans`, toasts the lines `doctor --kill-orphans` would print (joined with `; `), and repaints the card from a fresh `/api/doctor`.
- `tumwater doctor --kill-orphans` prints exactly what it printed before.
- The orphans check's fail detail names both the CLI flag and the dashboard button.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

### Kill orphans, part 2/2: the TUI Health pane's Ctrl+K twice kills the orphaned processes, the terminal twin of the dashboard's Kill orphans (planned 2026-10-20 by the plan role; requires part 1/2 landed for `orphanKillLines` and the `OrphanKillReport` export. Touches src/ui/tui/tui-keys.ts, src/ui/tui/tui-pane-session.ts, src/ui/tui/tui-panes.ts, src/ui/tui/tui-pane-health.ts, src/ui/tui/tui-frame.ts, docs/cli.md, test/tui-keys.test.ts, test/tui-frame.test.ts. Plain terms code run 15/20 later renames code in src/ui/tui/; this entry renames nothing)

**Goal.** The TUI's Health pane already has Ctrl+R (re-run), Ctrl+E (reclaim) and Ctrl+N (test notify) as twins of dashboard actions. It has no twin for the Kill orphans button from part 1/2. A terminal operator who sees the orphans row fail should be able to reap the processes without leaving the TUI.

**Approach.**
- src/ui/tui/tui-keys.ts: add a `killOrphans?(root: string): Promise<OrphanKillReport>` seam to the deps beside `runDoctor`, defaulting to `(r) => killOrphans(r)` from src/doctor/doctor-orphans.ts, and pass it into the session deps the same way `runDoctor: runDoctorSeam` is passed.
- src/ui/tui/tui-pane-session.ts: add `killOrphans(root)` to `TuiPanesDeps` and to the session, beside `runDoctor`. Add the armed pair `armedKillOrphans: boolean` and `killOrphansArmed: boolean`, both initially false and documented like `armedNotes`/`notesClearArmed`.
- src/ui/tui/tui-panes.ts: `beginKey` moves `killOrphansArmed` into `armedKillOrphans` and clears `killOrphansArmed`, the same as the other armed pairs. Extend its doc comment to say that only the Health Ctrl+K branch reads `armedKillOrphans`.
- src/ui/tui/tui-pane-health.ts: in `handleKey`, add a `key.ctrl && key.name === "k" && promptLineFree(ctx.es) && session.view === session.roleIds.length + 7` branch. If `session.armedKillOrphans` is false, set `session.killOrphansArmed = true` and flash `press Ctrl+K again to kill the orphaned processes the orphans check lists — any other key keeps them`. If it is true, flash `killing orphaned processes …` and call `session.killOrphans(session.root)`. When that resolves, flash `orphanKillLines(report).join("; ")`, then `run()`, `session.paneScroll = 0` and `requestRender()`, the same order Ctrl+E uses. A rejection goes to `session.flashError`. Write the comment block in the style of the Ctrl+E/Ctrl+N blocks. Ctrl+K is not bound on any view outside the prompt-line editor (src/ui/tui/tui-input.ts), and `promptLineFree` keeps that editor's kill-line binding.
- src/ui/tui/tui-frame.ts: the `health` hint list gets `["Ctrl+K", "kill orphans"]` after `["Ctrl+N", "test notify"]`.
- docs/cli.md: add a `Ctrl+K` row to the TUI key table (Health: twice kills the orphaned processes, like `tumwater doctor --kill-orphans` and the dashboard Health card's Kill orphans). The Audit row's `doctor` text names the TUI's Health Ctrl+K beside the dashboard button.

**Tests.**
- test/tui-keys.test.ts, beside "Ctrl+N on the Health view runs the notify hook once and flashes the outcome": "Ctrl+K twice on the Health view kills the orphans and flashes the lines". With an injected `killOrphans` that counts calls and resolves `{ killed: [{ pid: 4242, command: "node x", descendants: 0 }], failed: [] }`, the first Ctrl+K makes no call and flashes the press-again note. The second makes one call, flashes `killed pid 4242 node x`, and calls the injected `runDoctor` again.
- Same file: "a key between two Ctrl+K presses on the Health view disarms the kill". The sequence Ctrl+K, Ctrl+O, Ctrl+K makes no call.
- Same file: "Ctrl+K off the Health view never kills". Ctrl+K twice on Activity makes no call.
- test/tui-frame.test.ts: the health hint matches `/Ctrl\+K kill orphans/`.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- On the Health pane, Ctrl+K arms and a second consecutive Ctrl+K runs `killOrphans` once. The flash shows the same lines `doctor --kill-orphans` prints (joined with `; `), and the checks re-run.
- Any other key between the two presses cancels the kill. Ctrl+K on other views, and in the prompt-line editor, behaves as it does today.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.
