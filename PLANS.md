# Plans

Planned features, written by the plan loop and implemented by the feature loop.
Each plan: goal, approach, files touched, acceptance criteria. Move finished plans to Done;
tumwater then archives them in PLANS-DONE.md, so this file holds only open work.

## Planned

### Subtract, part 4/6: One runner per role — the instance claims and the worktree pool go (planned 2026-10-26 by the operator; design in plans/subtract.md "The six strokes", stroke 4, and its measurement gate; requires Subtract part 3g/7 landed; touches src/config/config-schema.ts src/config/config.ts src/config/config-validation.ts src/roles/runner-ids.ts src/scheduling/claims.ts src/scheduling/claim-entries.ts src/backlog/backlog-index.ts src/git/worktree-pool.ts src/git/worktree-pool-startup.ts src/git/slots-state.ts src/git/worktree-use.ts src/git/slot-salvage.ts src/doctor/doctor-contention-checks.ts src/ui/status-payload.ts docs/config.md test/worktree-pool.test.ts test/retention.test.ts)

**Needs review 2026-10-31 by the director:** the 2026-10-31 request to expose feature and bugfix concurrency under Settings keeps the `roles.<role>.instances` mechanism — its runners, claims and multiple worktrees — that this part deletes; re-plan only the worktree-pool work that can land without removing that instance mechanism, or withdraw this part.

**Goal.** One runner id per role and one persistent checkout per role. `instances`, the instance claims and the slot pool existed to keep a role authoring while its own change merged (fast-merge measured 60% of role time waiting); with landing in minutes that wait is not the constraint, and the pool's own costs — slot waits, pins, stale claims, salvage — go with it.

**Approach.**
- **Measure first, and record it.** Before changing code, read the day report and the log for the week after Subtract parts 3a/7–3g/7 landed: end-of-run → on main p50/mean/p90 (`merge_done`), `slot_wait` count and total, and red-main minutes (`main_check`/`main_red_hold`). If p90 is at or under ~15 minutes with one runner per role, proceed; if not, hold this part with a `**Needs review …**` note quoting the numbers instead of deleting capacity on a prediction.
- Delete the `instances` key (config-schema.ts, config.ts, docs/config.md) and `INSTANCE_ROLES`; `runnerIds` (src/roles/runner-ids.ts) returns the configured roles, one runner each.
- Delete the claims (src/scheduling/claims.ts, src/scheduling/claim-entries.ts) and their readers (backlog-index.ts's live-claim marks, status-payload.ts's instance pool, the `parallel instances` doctor row); a role claims an entry by working on it in the run that picked it up.
- Delete the pool (src/git/worktree-pool.ts, worktree-pool-startup.ts, slots-state.ts, worktree-use.ts, slot-salvage.ts) and the `slot_wait` event; a role keeps one worktree through src/git/worktree.ts's ensureWorktree, which already self-heals a dead registration.
- Delete the pool rows and their inputs: doctor's `workspaces` (pool half), `parallel instances`, `tumwater pins`' pool wording, and `slotCount`.

**Files touched.** src/config/config-schema.ts src/config/config.ts src/config/config-validation.ts src/roles/runner-ids.ts src/scheduling/claims.ts src/scheduling/claim-entries.ts src/backlog/backlog-index.ts src/git/worktree-pool.ts src/git/worktree-pool-startup.ts src/git/slots-state.ts src/git/worktree-use.ts src/git/slot-salvage.ts src/doctor/doctor-contention-checks.ts src/doctor/doctor-check-names.ts src/ui/status-payload.ts docs/config.md docs/how-it-works.md test/worktree-pool.test.ts test/retention.test.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- One runner id per configured role; `tumwater status --json` carries no instance-pool or slot fields, and a run leases no slot.
- `tumwater.json` with `instances` set is refused by validation naming the deleted key (the same treatment the other deleted keys get in parts 5a/6–5h/6), not silently ignored.
- The measured p90 end-of-run → on main from the gate above is quoted in the part's PLANS-DONE entry, so the deletion's premise is on the record.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

### Subtract, part 6/6: The sweep — the rows, keys and docs the five parts left behind (planned 2026-10-26 by the operator; design in plans/subtract.md "The six strokes" and "How we will know it worked"; requires Subtract part 1e/6, Subtract part 4/6, Subtract part 5v/6 and Subtract part 5x/6 landed, the ends of every remaining Subtract chain — a clause the operator added 2026-10-28 after feature refused this part for running ahead of them, re-pointed from part 5q/6 to part 5d/6 the same day when the user withdrew the budget-fallback removal and the tier map; touches docs/config.md docs/cli.md docs/glossary.md docs/how-it-works.md docs/invariants.md README.md DEVELOPMENT.md tumwater.example.json src/doctor/doctor-check-names.ts test/doctor-checks.test.ts test/event-format.test.ts test/retention.test.ts test/config.test.ts)

**Goal.** The deletion reads as one system. Every name parts 1/6–5/6 removed is gone from the live docs, the example config, the doctor's row list, the alerts and the tests that assert them; the archive keeps the record.

**Approach.**
- Sweep the deleted names out of the live prose and the example config: `instances`, `slotCount`, `slot_wait`, `check_wait`, `maxConcurrentChecks`, `mergeBatchMax`, `mergeCommand`, `review.afterMerge`, `maxConcurrentPerProvider`, `claudeWindowReserve`, `windowReserve`, `slot salvage`, `merge queue`, `interlock`, `held-for-operator`, `Needs replan`, `Waiting for the next failure`, `(held N)`.
- Delete the rows and tests rather than re-pointing them: a case whose whole subject is a deleted mechanism goes (the existing wording/implementation tests rule: never re-pin), and test/doctor-checks.test.ts's row list, test/event-format.test.ts's deleted event types (`slot_wait`, `check_wait`, the merge-stage events), test/retention.test.ts's pool artifacts and test/config.test.ts's deleted keys are updated to the surviving row/key set.
- Re-check the parts 1a–1e/6 rule end to end: for every condition that used to have a banner and no longer does, the doctor row exists; for every row this series deleted, the mechanism is gone.
- docs/invariants.md drops or re-scopes the invariants of deleted subsystems (merge-slot, pool, permit, instance claims, provider caps, subscription-window holds) in the same commit, per the standing rule; the tiers, the budget fallback and the image reroute stay (user, 2026-10-28), so their invariants stay too, and so does the subscription usage-window display (`subscriptionWindows`, the window badge and spend card — user, 2026-10-30, plans/subtract.md stroke 5).
- Record in the part's PLANS-DONE entry: the doctor row count and the config key count before and after the series, and the measurement table from plans/subtract.md "Before deleting concurrency and model policy".

**Files touched.** docs/config.md docs/cli.md docs/glossary.md docs/how-it-works.md docs/invariants.md README.md DEVELOPMENT.md tumwater.example.json src/doctor/doctor-check-names.ts PLANS.md test/doctor-checks.test.ts test/event-format.test.ts test/retention.test.ts test/config.test.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `grep -rnE 'maxConcurrentChecks|maxConcurrentPerProvider|mergeBatchMax|mergeCommand|instances|slot_wait|check_wait|claudeWindowReserve|review\.afterMerge|held-for-operator' src/ docs/ README.md DEVELOPMENT.md tumwater.example.json` finds no live reference (the archive files PLANS-DONE.md and BUGS-FIXED.md are excluded by construction).
- Every doctor row name in doctor-check-names.ts resolves to a check that reads a mechanism that still exists; no row reports a path nothing writes.
- The before/after row and key counts, and the deletions' measurement premise, are in the part's PLANS-DONE entry.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

### Every commit is verified on main, part 4j/3: the `main_red` run-result verdict is removed from the status, doctor, UI and report surfaces (planned 2026-10-29 by the plan role, split from the too-large part 3f/3; requires Subtract part 3b/7 landed, so no merge produces the verdict; touches src/merge/merge-core.ts src/ui/tone.ts src/events/event-labels.ts src/ui/gui/gui-client-model.ts src/failure/failure-data.ts src/failure/failure-time-spend.ts src/failure/failure-render.ts src/cli/cli-start-summary.ts src/status/status-polls.ts src/ui/status-model.ts src/doctor/doctor-holds.ts src/inbox/pending-prompt.ts src/review/review.ts src/run/run-finalize.ts src/run/run-prompt.ts src/orchestrator/orchestrator-poll.ts src/merge/merge-verify.ts src/merge/merge-queue.ts src/runner/runner-state.ts src/budget/fallback-breaker.ts src/events/event-notify.ts src/baseline/main-red.ts test/attribute-red-check.test.ts test/budget.test.ts test/doctor-holds.test.ts test/failure-render.test.ts test/failure-time-spend.test.ts test/gui-client.test.ts test/status-model.test.ts test/status-render-cells.test.ts test/status-render.test.ts test/team-alerts.test.ts)

**Goal.** With Subtract part 3b/7 deleting `gateBuildPrecheck`, the merge gate has no path that sets `mainRed`/`awaitingWatch`, so no merge produces a `main_red` run result. Remove the dead merge branch and the fields it read, then delete the surfaces that read or render the verdict. Leave the `RunResult` member and the recovered-pin plumbing for part 4k/3 to remove last, so this part can merge on its own without a compile-forced sweep of the run/runner plumbing.

**Approach.**
- Delete the now-unreachable producer: the `mainRed` and `awaitingWatch` fields and their comments in src/review/review.ts's `GateResult` (only `gateBuildPrecheck` set them), and src/merge/merge-core.ts's `if (gate.decision === "failed" && gate.mainRed)` branch that returns `result: "main_red"` (with its comment and the `awaitingWatch` spread). The plain `gate.decision === "failed"` branch stays.
- Remove the verdict from the display tables: `resultTone`'s `case "main_red"` and `"main_red"` in `PROBLEM_RESULTS` (src/ui/tone.ts), `main_red: "main's check is failing"` from `RUN_RESULT_LABELS` (src/events/event-labels.ts), `main_red: "red"` from the dashboard's `RESULT_TONES` (src/ui/gui/gui-client-model.ts), `main_red: 9` from `RESULT_ORDER` (src/failure/failure-render.ts), `"main_red"` from `CLUSTERED_RESULTS` (src/failure/failure-time-spend.ts), the `ev.result === "main_red"` clause (src/failure/failure-data.ts) and `"main_red"` from the start-summary list (src/cli/cli-start-summary.ts).
- Delete the status/doctor readers: `heldByMainRed` and `mainCheckRecovered` (src/status/status-polls.ts), the `main red` label branch and its import (`src/ui/status-model.ts`), and the held-code-role list inside `checkMainRed` (`src/doctor/doctor-holds.ts`). The unheld red-main warning (`redMainWarning`) and the `main_red_hold` event machinery stay.
- The `RunResult` member `main_red` (`src/run/run-outcome.ts`) stays, as do `runner-recovery.ts`'s recovered-pin producer, `merge-requeue.ts`'s `result === "main_red"` branch and the run/runner/review plumbing — part 4k/3 removes them.
- Refresh comments that name the verdict as a live status: `src/ui/status-model.ts`, `src/inbox/pending-prompt.ts`, `src/review/review.ts`, `src/run/run-finalize.ts`, `src/run/run-prompt.ts`, `src/orchestrator/orchestrator-poll.ts`, `src/merge/merge-verify.ts`, `src/merge/merge-queue.ts`, `src/runner/runner-state.ts`, `src/budget/fallback-breaker.ts`, `src/events/event-notify.ts`, `src/baseline/main-red.ts`.

**Files touched.** src/review/review.ts src/merge/merge-core.ts src/ui/tone.ts src/events/event-labels.ts src/ui/gui/gui-client-model.ts src/failure/failure-data.ts src/failure/failure-time-spend.ts src/failure/failure-render.ts src/cli/cli-start-summary.ts src/status/status-polls.ts src/ui/status-model.ts src/doctor/doctor-holds.ts src/inbox/pending-prompt.ts src/run/run-finalize.ts src/run/run-prompt.ts src/orchestrator/orchestrator-poll.ts src/merge/merge-verify.ts src/merge/merge-queue.ts src/runner/runner-state.ts src/budget/fallback-breaker.ts src/events/event-notify.ts src/baseline/main-red.ts test/attribute-red-check.test.ts test/budget.test.ts test/doctor-holds.test.ts test/failure-render.test.ts test/failure-time-spend.test.ts test/gui-client.test.ts test/status-model.test.ts test/status-render-cells.test.ts test/status-render.test.ts test/team-alerts.test.ts test/merger.test.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- No status, doctor, UI, failure or CLI surface reads or renders the `main_red` verdict: `heldByMainRed` and `mainCheckRecovered` are gone, and `grep -rnE '\bmain_red\b' src/ui src/status src/doctor src/failure src/cli src/events src/inbox src/budget` finds no verdict reference (`main_red_hold` still matches nothing under `\bmain_red\b` and stays).
- The merge gate no longer returns `main_red`: `grep -rn 'result: "main_red"' src/merge` prints nothing, and `GateResult` declares neither `mainRed` nor `awaitingWatch`.
- The `RunResult` member `main_red` still exists (part 4k/3 removes it), so the tree compiles without the run/runner sweep.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

**Tests.**
- test/doctor-holds.test.ts / test/status-model.test.ts / test/status-render.test.ts / test/status-render-cells.test.ts / test/team-alerts.test.ts: the held-by-main-red cases go; the unheld red-main warning cases stay.
- test/attribute-red-check.test.ts / test/budget.test.ts / test/failure-render.test.ts / test/failure-time-spend.test.ts / test/gui-client.test.ts: the `main_red` rows/labels/tone cases go; the surviving result cases stay.
- test/merger.test.ts: the `verifyAndMerge` `main_red` case goes; the surviving merge cases stay.

### Every commit is verified on main, part 4k/3: the `main_red` union member and the run/runner plumbing that names it are removed (planned 2026-10-29 by the plan role, split from the too-large part 3f/3; requires part 4j/3 landed, so no merge produces the verdict and no surface reads it; touches src/run/run-outcome.ts src/runner/runner-recovery.ts src/merge/merge-requeue.ts src/runner/runner-leftover.ts src/runner/runner-state-load.ts src/runner/runner-run.ts src/run/run-apply.ts src/run/run-finalize.ts src/run/run-prompt.ts src/orchestrator/orchestrator-poll.ts src/runner/runner-state.ts src/events/event-notify.ts src/inbox/pending-prompt.ts src/review/review.ts src/merge/merge-verify.ts src/merge/merge-queue.ts src/budget/fallback-breaker.ts src/baseline/main-red.ts test/run-outcome.test.ts test/run-apply.test.ts test/run-finalize.test.ts test/runner-recovery.test.ts test/runner-red-main.test.ts test/runner-leftover.test.ts test/merge-requeue.test.ts test/merge-pipeline-2.test.ts test/merger.test.ts)

**Goal.** The `main_red` run result no longer has a producer (Subtract part 3b/7 removed the gate's `mainRed` path, whose dead branch part 4j/3 deletes; the recovered-pin return removed here is the last one) or a reader (part 4j/3), so the union member itself is dead vocabulary. Remove it and let the compiler name any site still constructing or narrowing it.

**Approach.**
- Remove `| "main_red"` and its doc comment from `RunResult` (src/run/run-outcome.ts). Deleting the member makes every remaining construction or `result === "main_red"` narrowing a compile error, which is the work list.
- Remove the last producer: `runner-recovery.ts`'s recovered-`main_red` return, with the `main_red_wait` result in src/runner/runner-leftover.ts and the `mainRedRetry` record in src/merge/merge-requeue.ts, src/runner/runner-state.ts and src/runner/runner-state-load.ts that feed it. With merge-requeue.ts's `result === "main_red"` branch gone, nothing sets the record any more, so the pin's wait/recovery path, its state key, the orchestrator poll's `requeueMainRedPin` call and the leftover's `mainRedWait` return go with it; keep the stale/dangling pin cleanup and conflict hand-back. Fix any surviving switch/type-narrowing the compiler flags (run-apply, run-finalize and the run prompt), keeping each site's non-`main_red` behavior.
- Refresh the comments that still name the verdict as a live outcome in `src/runner/runner-state.ts`, `src/runner/runner-recovery.ts`, `src/run/run-finalize.ts`, `src/run/run-prompt.ts`, `src/orchestrator/orchestrator-poll.ts`, `src/events/event-notify.ts`, `src/inbox/pending-prompt.ts`, `src/review/review.ts`, `src/merge/merge-verify.ts`, `src/merge/merge-queue.ts`, `src/budget/fallback-breaker.ts` and `src/baseline/main-red.ts`.

**Files touched.** src/run/run-outcome.ts src/runner/runner-recovery.ts src/merge/merge-requeue.ts src/runner/runner-leftover.ts src/runner/runner-state-load.ts src/runner/runner-run.ts src/run/run-apply.ts src/run/run-finalize.ts src/run/run-prompt.ts src/orchestrator/orchestrator-poll.ts src/runner/runner-state.ts src/events/event-notify.ts src/inbox/pending-prompt.ts src/review/review.ts src/merge/merge-verify.ts src/merge/merge-queue.ts src/budget/fallback-breaker.ts src/baseline/main-red.ts test/run-outcome.test.ts test/run-apply.test.ts test/run-finalize.test.ts test/runner-recovery.test.ts test/runner-red-main.test.ts test/runner-leftover.test.ts test/merge-requeue.test.ts test/merge-pipeline-2.test.ts test/merger.test.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `RunResult` has no `main_red` member, and `grep -rnE '\bmain_red\b' src/` prints nothing (the `main_red_hold` event and its machinery stay; `\bmain_red\b` does not match `main_red_hold`).
- No code path returns or narrows on a `main_red` run result; the compiler is clean.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

**Tests.**
- test/run-outcome.test.ts: the `main_red` membership case goes; the surviving `RunResult` cases stay.
- test/runner-recovery.test.ts / test/runner-red-main.test.ts: the recovered-`main_red` cases go; the surviving recovery cases stay.
- test/run-apply.test.ts / test/run-finalize.test.ts / test/merge-pipeline-2.test.ts / test/merger.test.ts: drop the `main_red` assertions; the surviving cases stay.

_None yet._

### Subtract, part 3b/7: The pre-merge verify stops running the project's build check (planned 2026-10-31 by the plan role, splitting the 2026-10-30 too-large part 3/6; requires Subtract part 3a/7 landed; touches src/review/review.ts src/review/review-precheck.ts src/merge/merge-core.ts src/merge/merge-batch.ts src/merge/merge-verify.ts docs/how-it-works.md docs/invariants.md test/review.test.ts test/review-precheck.test.ts test/review-precheck-watch.test.ts test/merge-pipeline-watch.test.ts)

**Goal.** A merge's verify judges the diff's deterministic rules and nothing else: it runs no build check, so main has exactly one full check per merged commit, the main watch's post-landing one. Remove `gateBuildPrecheck` and the `verifiedHead`/`knownMainFailures` hand-off it carries; keep `diffRuleReasons`'s three hard rejects (brief block, PRINCIPLES edit, secret leak) and the md-only exempt path.

**Approach.**
- Delete src/review/review-precheck.ts in whole — its only export is `gateBuildPrecheck` and its only caller is review.ts. `reviewAttempt` in review.ts returns `{ decision: "approved" }` after the diff rules and before any build run; remove its `pre`/`retry.pre` fields, its check-slot lease, its flake/quarantine branches and its `verifiedHead` result field.
- Remove `verifiedHead` from `MergeRequest` (merge-core.ts), `VerifyVerdict`/`verifyRequestIn` (merge-batch.ts), `ApprovedMerge` (merge-pipeline.ts), `startVerify` (merge-verify.ts) and the red-baseline seed it feeds.
- The `merge_red`/`main_red` attribution paths that read the pre-check's result stay for the Every commit is verified on main 4j/3–4k/3 parts to remove; this part deletes only the pre-check call and its result field.
- docs/how-it-works.md's Review section says the pre-merge gate is the deterministic diff rules only; docs/invariants.md re-points the build-check bindings from the verify to the main watch.

**Files touched.** src/review/review.ts src/review/review-precheck.ts src/merge/merge-core.ts src/merge/merge-batch.ts src/merge/merge-verify.ts docs/how-it-works.md docs/invariants.md test/review.test.ts test/review-precheck.test.ts test/review-precheck-watch.test.ts test/merge-pipeline-watch.test.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- A verify of an ordinary change emits no `build_check` event and starts no pi/check run; it approves on the diff rules alone. A diff editing the brief block, PRINCIPLES.md or a credential is still rejected before it merges.
- `grep -rn 'gateBuildPrecheck\|verifiedHead' src/` prints nothing.
- The main watch's post-landing `build_check` still runs for every merged tip; the pre-check's tests are deleted or re-pointed to the watch, never left asserting a mechanism that is gone.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

**Tests.** test/review.test.ts: the approved path approves without a check, the three diff-rule rejects stay. test/review-precheck.test.ts and test/review-precheck-watch.test.ts: delete the pre-check cases (the whole subject is gone) and keep the watch cases that now own build verification. test/merge-pipeline-watch.test.ts: drop the `verifiedHead` seeding assertions. Run those files and the gate.

### Subtract, part 3c/7: The queue's verify stage collapses into the merge step (planned 2026-10-31 by the plan role, splitting the 2026-10-30 too-large part 3/6; requires Subtract part 3b/7 landed; touches src/merge/merge-drain.ts src/merge/merge-verify.ts src/merge/merge-batch.ts src/merge/merge-pipeline.ts src/merge/merge-core.ts src/merge/merge-slot.ts docs/how-it-works.md docs/invariants.md test/merge-drain.test.ts test/merge-drain-verify.test.ts test/merge-pipeline.test.ts test/merge-pipeline-2.test.ts test/merge-pipeline-seams.test.ts test/merger.test.ts test/fixtures/orchestrator-fixtures.ts test/fixtures/merger-fixtures.ts)

**Goal.** A queued entry goes straight from the queue to the merge step: no separate verify task, no `approved`/`verifying` map, no stage events. `drainMerge` takes the head entry, runs the deterministic diff-rule gate in the merge worktree, and calls `mergeApprovedChange`; a rejected entry is settled as today. The durable queue still orders entries and the pin still carries the commit.

**Approach.**
- Delete src/merge/merge-verify.ts and src/merge/merge-batch.ts; move the tier constants still needed by merge-drain/merge-post-review-drain (`MERGE_TIER`, `resolveAuthor`) beside the drain.
- In merge-core.ts, keep `reviewPinnedChange`'s deterministic gate as a small `reviewQueuedChange(ctx, req, wt, state)` without the approval/stage bookkeeping; call it from `mergeApprovedChangeIn` before `mergeToMain`. A rejected result deletes the pin and returns `rejected`; a diff-rule approval proceeds to the merge.
- In merge-drain.ts, delete `drainMergeQueue`'s `drainVerify` leg and the `p.approved`/`p.verifying` handling; `drainMerge` starts the next queued entry directly. In merge-pipeline.ts, remove `verifying`/`approved` and their types; keep `InFlightMerge`, abort, guard and outcome plumbing. In merge-slot.ts, remove the verify stage records and `checkWaitStage`/`resolveWaitStage` hooks, keeping the merge in-flight marker the operator surfaces read.
- Keep `drainPostReviews` and the post-merge review path untouched.
- docs/how-it-works.md's Parallel approval and Merge sections describe the one-step drain; docs/invariants.md re-points the verify-stage bindings to the merge step.

**Files touched.** src/merge/merge-drain.ts src/merge/merge-verify.ts src/merge/merge-batch.ts src/merge/merge-pipeline.ts src/merge/merge-core.ts src/merge/merge-slot.ts docs/how-it-works.md docs/invariants.md test/merge-drain.test.ts test/merge-drain-verify.test.ts test/merge-pipeline.test.ts test/merge-pipeline-2.test.ts test/merge-pipeline-seams.test.ts test/merger.test.ts test/fixtures/orchestrator-fixtures.ts test/fixtures/merger-fixtures.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- One queued entry produces `merge_queued → merged` with no verify-start/approved stage event; a merge is a rebase and a fast-forward through `mergeApprovedChange`.
- A queued diff that edits the brief block, PRINCIPLES.md or a credential is rejected before it merges; every other queued diff merges without a second review.
- `grep -rn 'drainVerify\|startVerify\|verifyRequest\|MERGE_TIER\|VERIFY_TIER' src/merge` prints only the moved constants if any, never a verify stage.
- test/merge-drain-verify.test.ts is deleted with its subject; the surviving merge-drain/pipeline tests assert the one-step drain.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

**Tests.** Delete test/merge-drain-verify.test.ts. Update test/merge-drain.test.ts, test/merge-pipeline.test.ts, test/merge-pipeline-2.test.ts, test/merge-pipeline-seams.test.ts and test/merger.test.ts to drive an entry from queue to merge without the verify/approved map; update the fixtures' `mergeHead` to the same path. Run those files and the gate.

### Subtract, part 3d/7: `tumwater queue`, its cancel/top keys and the browser queue controls go (planned 2026-10-31 by the plan role, splitting the 2026-10-30 too-large part 3/6; requires Subtract part 3c/7 landed; touches src/cli/cli-query-commands.ts src/gui/gui-operator-commands.ts src/gui/gui-server.ts src/ui/tui/tui-pane-pending.ts src/ui/tui/tui-pane-pending-selection.ts src/ui/tui/tui-pane-transcript.ts src/merge/merge-cancel.ts src/merge/merge-top.ts src/merge/merge-queue-render.ts docs/cli.md test/cli-queue.test.ts test/cli-queue-follow.test.ts test/gui-queue-cancel.test.ts test/gui-queue-top.test.ts test/merge-cancel.test.ts test/merge-top.test.ts test/tui-pane-pending.test.ts test/tui-operator-keys.test.ts)

**Goal.** The operator stops steering a queue that becomes a lock and a fast-forward: delete the `tumwater queue` command, its `--cancel` and `--top` flags, the GUI Merge queue card's Cancel/Move-to-top handlers, the TUI pending pane's queue rows and keys, and the three modules that implement cancel/top/queue rendering. The queue reader itself stays for status, doctor and the CLI surfaces this part does not own until part 3f.

**Approach.**
- Delete src/merge/merge-cancel.ts, src/merge/merge-top.ts and src/merge/merge-queue-render.ts; remove `cmdQueue`, `cmdQueueCancel`, `cmdQueueTop` and the queue view from src/cli/cli-query-commands.ts and their command/help/completion entries.
- Remove `handleQueueCancel`/`handleQueueTop` and their `/api/queue-cancel`/`/api/queue-top` routes from src/gui/gui-operator-commands.ts and gui-server.ts; delete the dashboard Merge queue card's Cancel/Move-to-top controls.
- Remove the merge-queue rows, labels and Ctrl keys from tui-pane-pending.ts, tui-pane-pending-selection.ts and tui-pane-transcript.ts; keep the post-merge-review rows, which are a separate mechanism.
- docs/cli.md drops `queue`, `queue --cancel` and `queue --top`; no other docs change here.

**Files touched.** src/cli/cli-query-commands.ts src/gui/gui-operator-commands.ts src/gui/gui-server.ts src/ui/tui/tui-pane-pending.ts src/ui/tui/tui-pane-pending-selection.ts src/ui/tui/tui-pane-transcript.ts src/merge/merge-cancel.ts src/merge/merge-top.ts src/merge/merge-queue-render.ts docs/cli.md test/cli-queue.test.ts test/cli-queue-follow.test.ts test/gui-queue-cancel.test.ts test/gui-queue-top.test.ts test/merge-cancel.test.ts test/merge-top.test.ts test/tui-pane-pending.test.ts test/tui-operator-keys.test.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `tumwater queue` and its `--cancel`/`--top` flags are gone from the parser, help, completion and docs; `grep -rn 'moveQueuedMergeToTop\|cancelQueuedMerge\|renderMergeQueue' src/` prints nothing.
- Neither dashboard nor TUI offers a queue cancel/top control, and no TUI key binds one.
- The queue reader (`readMergeQueue`), the post-merge-review views and the doctor/status queue reads still work.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

**Tests.** Delete test/cli-queue.test.ts, test/cli-queue-follow.test.ts, test/gui-queue-cancel.test.ts, test/gui-queue-top.test.ts, test/merge-cancel.test.ts and test/merge-top.test.ts with their subjects; trim test/tui-pane-pending.test.ts and test/tui-operator-keys.test.ts to the surviving post-review rows and keys. Run the surviving touched files and the gate.

### Subtract, part 3e/7: A run's merge pin is merged directly, without a queue entry (planned 2026-10-31 by the plan role, splitting the 2026-10-30 too-large part 3/6; requires Subtract part 3d/7 landed; touches src/run/run-stage.ts src/runner/runner-leftover.ts src/orchestrator/orchestrator-poll.ts src/merge/merge-core.ts docs/how-it-works.md test/run-stage.test.ts test/runner-leftover.test.ts test/orchestrator-merge-pin.test.ts)

**Goal.** New work stops writing a durable queue entry: a run pins its commit by `refs/tumwater/landing/<role>` and the orchestrator merges that pin on a poll. The queue reader still drains files an older build left, so the two paths coexist until part 3f deletes the queue.

**Approach.**
- In run-stage.ts, replace the `enqueueMerge` block with the pin only: after `pinAndReset`, log `merge_queued` with the commit and summary and end the run `queued` exactly as today; `heldOnBranch` still checks an existing pin. Remove the queue-entry construction from the fresh path; keep the revision trailer on the commit so a recovered pin still carries its round.
- In runner-leftover.ts, replace the `enqueueMerge` call with the same pin-only return (`{ kind: "pinned", sha, summary }`): adopt an unpinned branch tip into the merge ref as today, but write no queue file. Keep stale/dangling pin cleanup, the conflict hand-back and `MERGE_CONFLICT_LIMIT`.
- Add the pin merge to orchestrator-poll.ts: for each runner with `hasUnmergedPin` and no in-flight merge, read `recoveredMetadata` for the pinned sha and call the merge path (`mergeApprovedChange`) under the existing merge lock; a merged pin is deleted, a conflicting pin is kept for the existing leftover/conflict hand-back path, and a pin main already contains is dropped.
- docs/how-it-works.md's Merge section says a pin is the waiting state; the durable queue is legacy input only.

**Files touched.** src/run/run-stage.ts src/runner/runner-leftover.ts src/orchestrator/orchestrator-poll.ts src/merge/merge-core.ts docs/how-it-works.md test/run-stage.test.ts test/runner-leftover.test.ts test/orchestrator-merge-pin.test.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- A fresh run that commits writes a pin and no `.tumwater/merge-queue/` file; its log path is still `merge_queued → merged` and its change reaches main without a second check.
- A pin left by a crash or an earlier build is merged on the next poll; a pin whose commit main already contains is deleted without merging.
- A conflicting pin is kept once and hands back to its author at `MERGE_CONFLICT_LIMIT`, not retried forever.
- Old queue files still drain through the pre-3e path until part 3f removes it.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

**Tests.** New test/orchestrator-merge-pin.test.ts: a pin is merged on a poll, a stale pin is dropped, a conflict keeps the pin and records the streak. test/run-stage.test.ts: a committed run pins and enqueues nothing. test/runner-leftover.test.ts: recovery adopts a tip into the pin and writes no queue file. Run those files and the gate.

### Subtract, part 3f/7: The durable merge queue and its status/doctor readers go (planned 2026-10-31 by the plan role, splitting the 2026-10-30 too-large part 3/6; requires Subtract part 3e/7 landed; touches src/merge/merge-queue.ts src/merge/merge-drain.ts src/merge/merge-pipeline.ts src/merge/merge-slot.ts src/merge/merge-requeue.ts src/status/status-data.ts src/status/status-roles.ts src/status/status-polls.ts src/doctor/doctor-backlog.ts src/doctor/doctor-check-names.ts src/doctor/doctor-holds.ts src/gates/gate-polls.ts src/scheduling/once-round.ts src/events/event-notify.ts docs/how-it-works.md test/merge-queue.test.ts test/merge-requeue.test.ts test/merge-slot.test.ts test/merge-pipeline.test.ts test/merge-pipeline-2.test.ts test/doctor-checks.test.ts test/status-data.test.ts test/status-roles.test.ts test/once-round.test.ts)

**Goal.** With part 3e writing no queue file, the queue, its pipeline, slot and requeue modules are dead state. Delete them and re-point every reader at the pin/in-flight marker: status shows a role's waiting pin, the doctor drops the two merge-queue rows, and `once --once` waits on no in-flight merge instead of an empty queue directory.

**Approach.**
- Delete src/merge/merge-queue.ts, merge-drain.ts, merge-pipeline.ts, merge-slot.ts and merge-requeue.ts; move the one in-flight marker type/reader the new pin path and post-review drain still need into a small module beside merge-core.ts, and delete `.tumwater/merge-queue/` handling (`mergeQueueDir`, `legacyLandQueueDir`, the startup migration step) from src/paths.ts and startup-migration-steps.ts.
- status-data.ts's `readMergeQueue` block and `queuedRoles` become the pin/in-flight set; status-roles.ts and status-polls.ts read that set. Delete the queue header badge, the queue depth and the per-role queued row that name a now-nonexistent directory.
- doctor-backlog.ts loses `checkStaleQueuedMerges` and `checkMergeQueueFiles`; doctor-check-names.ts drops `stale merge-queue entries` and `merge-queue files`; doctor-holds.ts reads the in-flight/pin set instead of the queue.
- gate-polls.ts and scheduling/once-round.ts read the in-flight/pin state for their `queued` counts instead of `queuedMergeRoles`/`queuedMerges`; once-round's `queuedMerges: number` becomes the pin count.
- events/event-notify.ts drops notifications that name queue files (`unreadable queue files`, `merge-queue file`), keeping `merge_queued`/`merged`.
- docs/how-it-works.md removes the queue directory, stages and queue doctor rows, describing pins and the in-flight marker instead.

**Files touched.** src/merge/merge-queue.ts src/merge/merge-drain.ts src/merge/merge-pipeline.ts src/merge/merge-slot.ts src/merge/merge-requeue.ts src/status/status-data.ts src/status/status-roles.ts src/status/status-polls.ts src/doctor/doctor-backlog.ts src/doctor/doctor-check-names.ts src/doctor/doctor-holds.ts src/gates/gate-polls.ts src/scheduling/once-round.ts src/events/event-notify.ts src/paths.ts src/orchestrator/startup-migration-steps.ts docs/how-it-works.md test/merge-queue.test.ts test/merge-requeue.test.ts test/merge-slot.test.ts test/merge-pipeline.test.ts test/merge-pipeline-2.test.ts test/doctor-checks.test.ts test/status-data.test.ts test/status-roles.test.ts test/once-round.test.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `grep -rn 'merge-queue\|mergeQueue\|queuedMerges\|readMergeQueue\|mergeQueueDir' src/` finds no live queue path; `docs/how-it-works.md` names no queue directory or stage.
- `tumwater status` shows each waiting role's pin and in-flight merge; the doctor's `stale merge-queue entries` and `merge-queue files` rows are gone rather than warning about a path nothing writes.
- `once --once` treats a waiting pin as unsettled work and exits only after its merge settles, the same way it treated a non-empty queue.
- No module imports a deleted merge-queue/merge-drain/merge-slot/merge-requeue file; the compiler is clean.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

**Tests.** Delete test/merge-queue.test.ts, test/merge-requeue.test.ts, test/merge-slot.test.ts and the queue-specific cases in test/merge-pipeline*.test.ts; update test/status-data.test.ts, test/status-roles.test.ts, test/doctor-checks.test.ts and test/once-round.test.ts to pins/in-flight. Run those files and the gate.

### Subtract, part 3g/7: Docs and invariants say one lock, linear history and a post-landing check (planned 2026-10-31 by the plan role, splitting the 2026-10-30 too-large part 3/6; requires Subtract part 3f/7 landed; touches docs/how-it-works.md docs/invariants.md docs/glossary.md README.md test/invariants-doc.test.ts test/merge-backlog-conflicts.test.ts)

**Goal.** The live prose and the invariant bindings describe the landing that exists after parts 3a–3f: a pin, a rebase under the merge lock, a fast-forward, and the main watch's post-landing check. No sentence promises queue stages, an approval step or a pre-merge check.

**Approach.**
- Sweep the queue vocabulary out of docs/how-it-works.md, docs/invariants.md and docs/glossary.md: merge queue, queue stage, verify/approval stage, batch/bisect (already gone), retry/requeue, queue depth and queue cancel/top.
- In docs/invariants.md, drop or re-scope every binding to a deleted module (`merge-queue`, `merge-verify`, `merge-batch`, `merge-slot` stages, `merge-requeue`) and state the surviving guarantees: one merge writer under one lock, linear history, a deleted pin on merge and a post-landing check per commit. Keep the conflict-hand-back and review-gate bindings that still have code.
- README's status line stays as is; remove any queue wording elsewhere in README.
- Re-check docs/invariants.md's file-to-test bindings: every remaining binding names a file and a test that still exist; the invariants-doc test enforces it.

**Files touched.** docs/how-it-works.md docs/invariants.md docs/glossary.md README.md test/invariants-doc.test.ts test/merge-backlog-conflicts.test.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- `grep -rniE 'merge queue|queue stage|verify stage|approval stage|requeue|queue depth' docs/ README.md` finds no claim about a mechanism parts 3a–3f deleted (the archive files PLANS-DONE.md and BUGS-FIXED.md are excluded by construction).
- Every docs/invariants.md binding that names a merge module names a file and a test that still exist; deleted-module INVs are gone, not re-pointed.
- The surviving prose says: a change is pinned, merged by rebase and fast-forward under the merge lock, and checked on main after it lands.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

**Tests.** Run test/invariants-doc.test.ts and test/merge-backlog-conflicts.test.ts whole, then the project's gate, and confirm green.

### The CLI's `main` command switch becomes a `COMMAND_HANDLERS` table keyed by command token, so each command's dispatch is one table row and `main` reads as the shared prelude, one lookup and the unknown-command fallback (planned 2026-10-31 by the plan role; continues the landed data-table conversion family — the 2026-10-29 `describeStateChange` plan turned its case switch into `STATE_CHANGE_FAMILY`, typed `Record<HarnessEvent["type"], …>` and read with a fallback (src/failure/failure-state-change.ts), and the in-flight `eventMessage` plan applies the same shape to `EVENT_MESSAGE_FAMILY`; `main` (src/cli.ts) is the largest remaining hand-listed dispatcher, an eslint one-shot complexity of 48 today, and every one of its arm bodies is already a one-line call to a `cmd…Case` helper or a lazy import, so the table moves no handler logic; independent in file of every `## Planned` entry — `grep -n 'src/cli\.ts' PLANS.md` prints nothing before this entry, `grep -c 'COMMAND_HANDLERS' PLANS.md PLANS-DONE.md` prints 0 and 0, and the open parts that name a `src/cli` path name `src/cli/cli-start-summary.ts`, `src/cli/cli-query-commands.ts`, `src/cli/help.ts` or `src/cli/completion.ts`, never `src/cli.ts`; PLANS-DONE.md records splits of other functions in `src/cli.ts` (`cmdDoctorCase`, `cmdReportCase`, `cmdRunDetail`) but no conversion of `main`'s dispatch (`grep -c 'COMMAND_HANDLERS' PLANS-DONE.md` prints 0); docs/invariants.md names no symbol in `src/cli.ts` (`grep -c 'src/cli\.ts' docs/invariants.md` prints 0), so a behavior-preserving move changes no pinned guarantee; touches src/cli.ts)

**Goal.** `main` (src/cli.ts) is the CLI's entry point: it runs the Node-floor gate, answers a `--help` topic, resolves the repo root, then dispatches the command token through a switch with 43 case labels plus the default. Every arm is already one line — a `cmd…Case` helper, or a lazy `await import(...)` of the command module — so the switch is routing data written as control flow, and a reader asking "which token reaches `cmdStatus`?", "which aliases share a body?" or "where did `tick` go?" scans all 43 labels. Its complexity is 48; the arms' bodies are not the reason. Make the routing one `COMMAND_HANDLERS` table so each command is one row and `main` holds the prelude, the lookup and the existing unknown-token fallback. No behavior change: the same token reaches the same helper with the same arguments, the lazy imports stay lazy, and the help text and every error wording stay byte-identical.

**Approach.** All edits in src/cli.ts; move each case body verbatim, keep each existing `//` comment with the arm it annotates, and add no import.
- Declare beside `main` a module-private `type CommandHandler = (root: string, command: string, args: string[]) => Promise<void>` and a `const COMMAND_HANDLERS: Readonly<Record<string, CommandHandler>>` above it. One entry per token the switch lists today, in the switch's order: `init`, `start` and `run`, `tui`, `gui`, `status`, `config`, `report`, `doctor`, `logs`, `notify`, `history`, `tick`, `diff`, `queue`, `reviews`, `backlog`, `quarantine`, `archive`, `bug`, `plan`, `questions`, `brief`, `role`, `prompt`, `reset-counters`, `wake`, `abort`, `pause`, `resume`, `reclaim`, `restart`, `retire`, `revert`, `stop`, `completion`, `version`, `--version`, `-v`, `help`, `--help`, `-h`.
- Each value is the body that case runs today, moved verbatim: a bare `cmd…Case` where the case calls one, or an async arrow that performs the case's same lazy `await import(…)` and call. `start`/`run`, `version`/`--version`/`-v` and `help`/`--help`/`-h` map to the same function reference, so an alias pair cannot drift. The seven marker commands map to one arrow that awaits `import("./cli/cli-marker-commands.js")` and calls `runMarkerCommand(root, command, args)`, so each keeps its own token.
- Replace the switch in `main` with the table: keep the Node-floor gate, the `helpTopicForArgs` answer and the `root` resolution exactly as they are. When `command` is undefined, take the `help` row directly (today's `case undefined` arm); otherwise take `COMMAND_HANDLERS[command]` only when `Object.hasOwn(COMMAND_HANDLERS, command)` is true, so a prototype name such as `constructor` falls to the unknown-command path, and leave the existing `default` body — `suggestCommand(command)` plus the same `fail(...)` wording — as the else arm. Await the chosen handler with `command`.
- Rewrite `main`'s doc comment to say the table is the dispatch, that aliases are repeated keys and the marker commands share one arrow, and that a new command must add its row here and its usage stanza in help.ts.
- No other file changes: help.ts, docs/cli.md, docs/how-it-works.md and every command module stay untouched.

**Files touched.** src/cli.ts

**Acceptance criteria.**
- Every token the switch routes today routes through the table to the same helper or the same lazy import with the same `(root, args)`, and each alias group (`start`/`run`, `tick` -> `runTrailCommand`, `version`/`--version`/`-v`, `help`/`--help`/`-h`, `undefined` -> help) lands on the same handler it does today; the seven marker tokens still reach `runMarkerCommand` with their own token.
- `main` still runs the Node-floor gate and `helpTopicForArgs` before dispatch and still resolves `root` the same way, and an unknown token still exits through `fail` with today's exact `unknown command: "<token>"` / `didYouMean` wording — test/cli-help.test.ts's unknown-command, near-miss and `--help does not rescue an unknown command` cases pass unedited.
- The complexity falls: `npx eslint --no-config-lookup -c docs/code-metrics/eslint-complexity.config.mjs 'src/cli.ts'` reports `main` at 10 or below (it reports 48 today), and reports no other function in the file higher than it does today.
- `grep -nE '^export ' src/cli.ts` matches today's exported lines (the file exports nothing new), and no `switch (command)` remains in `main`.
- No edit lands outside src/cli.ts; docs/invariants.md and src/cli/help.ts are unchanged.
- `npm run test:gate` passes.

**Tests.** No new test module: the conversion is behavior-preserving, and test/cli-help.test.ts already pins the dispatch's user-visible surface through the spawned CLI — the unknown-command failure and hint, the near-miss suggestion, `--help` not rescuing an unknown command, and the per-command help topics; test/help.test.ts pins the help listing itself and test/cli.test.ts drives the command routes. Run test/cli-help.test.ts, test/help.test.ts and test/cli.test.ts whole, then the project's gate, and confirm green. If a command-specific suite fails, the token's row is wrong; do not change a handler to make it pass.

### `assemblePayload`'s complexity-23 optional-spread assembly in src/roles/role-view.ts is split into one named partial builder per field concern — identity, agent seam, overrides, role config/detail and run history — so a reader asking "which fields describe this role's model seam?" finds them in one named function instead of scanning a 30-parameter object literal (planned 2026-10-31 by the plan role; … touches src/roles/role-view.ts) — superseded 2026-10-31 by the steward role: a same-day duplicate of the in-flight entry above — the identical split of the same `assemblePayload` in src/roles/role-view.ts, filed the same day (the surviving entry's independence note, `grep -c 'role-view' PLANS.md`, had not counted this one); only one can land, and the earlier entry in the queue does.

## Done
